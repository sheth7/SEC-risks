quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - ------------------------------------------------------------------- some of nucor's industrial revenue bonds have variable interest rates that are adjusted either weekly or annually. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor's remaining debt is at fixed rates. in addition, nucor's investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of nucor industrial revenue bonds have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly, monthly or annually. additionally, nucor entered into an interest rate swap agreement, converting a note payable of $175,000,000 from a fixed rate obligation to a variable rate obligation. nucor remaining debt is at fixed

revenue bonds have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. nucor remaining debt is at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. from time to time, nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. as of december 31, 2003, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2004, 43% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. the remaining 57% of nucor debt is at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. from time to time, nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2004, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. in the first quarter of 2004, nucor initiated a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the historically high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials. our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. 8 table of contents nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when it is deemed prudent to do so by management. gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive loss includes $1.2 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by $11.7 million and $29.1 million, respectively. any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive loss, net of tax. because these instruments are structured and used as hedges, these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle.risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. because steel producers generally have high fixed costs, reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies. over the five-year period ended december 31, 2005, our net earnings have varied from a high of $1.31 billion in 2005 to a low of $62.8 million in 2003. future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 4 table of contents overcapacity in the steel industry could increase the level of steel imports which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steel-making capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. this excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel at prices below their cost of production. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, has the potential to cause steel dumping in u.s. markets. a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could reduce demand for steel products in that country, resulting in china increasing steel exports. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. we acquire our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous sources throughout the country. although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities, purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. if our suppliers increase the price of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we plan to continue to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. realization of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these transactions with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. in addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the u.s., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. some of our competitors who have emerged from bankruptcy have lowered their operating costs, which could negatively impact our competitive position. over the past few years, many domestic steel companies have sought protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code and have continued to operate. some have reduced prices to maintain volumes and cash flows and obtained concessions from their labor unions and suppliers. in some cases, they have even expanded and modernized while in bankruptcy. upon emergence from bankruptcy, these companies, or new entities that purchase their facilities through the bankruptcy process, may be relieved of certain environmental, retiree and other obligations. additionally, some of our competitors may grow by acquiring less expensive capacity out of bankruptcy. as a result, they may be able to operate with lower costs, a primary competitive factor in the steel industry, which could negatively affect our competitive position. 5 table of contents competition from other materials may materially adversely affect our business. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could materially adversely affect prices and demand for our steel products. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steel-making business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2005, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $1.34 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $700.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. any future significant acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are evolving and becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. we have agreed to a comprehensive consent decree with the united states environmental protection agency and certain states in order to resolve alleged past environmental violations. under the terms of the consent decree, we are conducting tests at some of our facilities, performing corrective action where necessary, and piloting certain pollution control technologies. the accrued environmental costs include the expenses that we expect to incur as a result of the consent decree. we believe our competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations. the specific impact on each competitor may vary, however, depending upon a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, production processes (such as a mini-mill versus an integrated producer) and the specific products and services it provides. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course

million in unrealized net-of-tax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments. a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by $20.1 million and $50.0 million, respectively. any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. because these instruments are structured and used as hedges, these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle.risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of

conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of low-priced, unfairly traded steel to the united states. in recent years, capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in china increasing steel exports. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. we acquire our primary raw

materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steel making processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses (ghg s). the u.s. house of representatives has recently created a select committee on energy independence and global warming. the speaker of the house has also asked other committees in the house that have jurisdiction over energy, environment and technology policy to report legislation on these issues by june 2007. we expect the 6 table of contents item 1a. risk factors, continued legislation, when adopted, will increase our energy and other operating costs. unless this legislation addresses ghg globally, these increased costs would hurt our ability to compete with foreign steel producers who would not be subject to this legislation. these increased costs could also encourage more of our customers to relocate their manufacturing facilities to foreign countries that do not restrict ghg emissions and where nucor is not positioned to sell or distribute our products. this legislation is also likely to increase energy costs for all u.s. consumers resulting in a weaker domestic economy. we plan to continue to implement acquisition strategies and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire.

materials and energy, principally scrap steel and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the high cost of scrap steel and other raw materials. our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. 10 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, continued nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process when management believes it is prudent to do so. gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2007, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes $4.0 million in unrealized net-of-tax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments. a sensitivity analysis of changes in the price of hedged natural gas purchases indicates that declines of 10% and 25% in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value of our natural gas hedge position by $32.5 million and $81.3 million, respectively. any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. because these instruments are structured and used as hedges, these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the natural gas used in the normal production cycle. foreign currency risk prior to the acquisition of harris steel, nucor was principally a domestic manufacturer of steel and steel products with customers located primarily in the u.s. nucor was exposed to currency fluctuations, however, due to its joint ventures in brazil and australia and the direct reduced iron facility in trinidad. when the company entered into the agreement to acquire harris steel in january 2007, nucor became exposed to canadian currency fluctuations and hedged a portion of the exposure associated with the closing of the transaction in march 2007. the company continues to be exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada.risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 6 table of contents item 1a. risk factors, continued the current global recession and credit crisis have and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business. the current deep and potentially prolonged global recession that officially began in the united states in december 2007 has, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2008, had a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows. in mid-february 2009, the federal reserve warned that the united states economy faces an unusually gradual and prolonged period of recovery from this deep and recessionary period. the financial and credit crisis that intensified the current recession also triggered a period of upheaval characterized by bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale at nominal amounts of various financial institutions. despite the unprecedented level of intervention in the credit markets by the u.s. and foreign governments that has already occurred and is likely to continue to occur, this crisis could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility. the financial and credit crisis is also making in difficult or, in many cases, impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations. their lack of or limited access to capital adversely affects their ability to purchase our products or, in some cases, to pay for our products on a timely basis. our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. because steel producers generally have high fixed costs, reduced volumes result in operating inefficiencies. over the six-year period ended december 31, 2008, our net earnings have varied from a record high of $1.83 billion in 2008 to a low of $64.8 million in 2003. future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steel-making capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products, particularly during periods of global recession. this excess capacity results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of low-priced, unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states. in recent years, capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in china increasing steel exports. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes, that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although nucor has vertically integrated its business through the successful start-up of our dri facility in trinidad and through the acquisition of djj, we may still be required to purchase our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources throughout 7 table of contents item 1. risk factors, continued the country. although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities, purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather and political and economic factors beyond our control. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steel making processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our customers and suppliers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses (ghg s). in 2008, several bills were introduced but not passed in the united states senate that would regulate ghg and carbon dioxide emissions. similar bills will be introduced in 2009. this legislation, when adopted, will increase our energy and other operating costs. this proposed legislation regulates domestic production but excludes imports from the same standards for a period of eight years, which will make domestic manufacturing uncompetitive with imported products during this time. these increased costs could also encourage more of our customers to relocate their manufacturing facilities to foreign countries that do not regulate ghg emissions and where nucor is not positioned to sell or distribute our products. this proposed legislation is also likely to increase energy costs for all u.s. consumers resulting in a weaker domestic economy. we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. in addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the u.s., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. 8 table of contents item 1. risk factors, continued competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect our business. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. congress has raised the corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks produced beginning in 2011. automobile producers may reduce the steel content of cars and trucks to achieve the new cafe fuel economy standards, reducing demand for steel and resulting in an over-supply in north america. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steel-making business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2008, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $2.50 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive steel products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results. some of our steel products and other subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, their results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate to fewer u.s. dollars. the accounting treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment. the results of this calculation may be affected by the current adverse market conditions for the steel industry, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. if impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings. 9 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2008, 14% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. the remaining 86% of nucor debt is at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2008, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials. as a result of the rapid fall-off in sales due to weaker market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we are beginning 2009 with high inventories of more expensive scrap and scrap substitutes. since pig iron and certain grades of scrap have lead times of four to six months, dramatically reduced sales volumes resulted in the accumulation of increased tons of inventories ordered at peak market prices. if market conditions remain depressed for a prolonged period, it will take longer for us to work through these expensive raw materials (primarily pig iron at our sheet mills). 13 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, continued nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2008, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes $66.0 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2008, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 143,614 $ 201,900 aluminum 1,485 3,711 copper 218 545 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada and trinidad and its joint ventures in australia and italy. in the first half of 2008, the company entered into forward foreign currency contracts in order to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation on the anticipated joint venture with the duferco group of lugano, switzerland. these contracts had a notional value of 423.5 million and matured in the second quarter of 2008 resulting in gains of $17.6 million. these contracts all settled during the second quarter of 2008.risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. the current global recession and credit crisis have and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business. the current deep and potentially prolonged global recession that officially began in the united states in december 2007 has, since the third quarter of 2008, had a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows. a continued recession both globally and in the united states, or the public perception that a recession is continuing, could continue to depress demand for our products and adversely affect our business. since the financial and credit crisis began, the u.s. government and the federal reserve bank have created a number of programs that have helped to stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity. despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that these programs, individually or collectively, will continue to have beneficial effects on the markets overall, or will resolve the credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs. although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities, this current crisis could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility. the recession is also making it difficult or, in many cases, impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations. their lack of, or limited access to, capital would adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or, in some cases, to pay for our products on a timely basis. our industry is cyclical and prolonged economic declines could have a material adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, appliance and automotive. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the current global economic recession, coupled with the continued global financial and credit market disruptions, have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor. these events have contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products, weak end-markets and continued depressed demand, all resulting in historic volatility in our financial results year over year. nucor reported record high earnings of $1.83 billion in 2008 and recorded the company first net loss of $294 million in 2009. while nucor believes that the long-term prospects for steel remain bright, the company is unable to predict the duration or severity of the current global recession. future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steel-making capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products, particularly during periods of global recession. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant 8 table of contents item 1a. risk factors, continued amounts of steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of low-priced, unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states. in recent years, capacity growth in china has significantly exceeded the growth in chinese market demand. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes, that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although nucor has vertically integrated its business through our dri facility in trinidad and through the acquisition of djj, we are still required to purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources throughout the country. although we believe that the supply of scrap is adequate to operate our facilities, purchase prices of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather and political and economic factors beyond our control. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steel making processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses , and pending legislation or regulation of ghg s, if enacted or adopted in an onerous form, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor will be affected, both directly and indirectly, if proposed climate change legislation, such as use of a cap and trade 9 table of contents item 1. a. risk factors, continued policy, is enacted into law or, alternatively, regulations intended to reduce ghg emissions are adopted by the epa. the impact of legislation and regulations on nucor and its suppliers and customers will depend on a number of factors, including whether ghg sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall ghg emissions cap level, the degree to which ghg offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on electricity and natural gas prices. if such legislation is enacted or regulations are adopted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. in addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the u.s., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect our business. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. congress has raised the corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks produced beginning in 2011. automobile producers may reduce the steel content of cars and trucks to help achieve the new cafe fuel economy standards, reducing demand for steel and resulting in an over-supply in north america. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steel-making business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2009, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $2.60 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies to be financed by internally 10 table of contents item 1a. risk factors, continued generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results. some of our steel products and other subsidiaries conduct their business in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, their results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate to fewer u.s. dollars. a strong u.s. dollar also hampers our international trading and distribution business. weak local currencies limit the amount of u.s. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limits our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically calculate the fair value of our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to test for impairment. the results of this calculation may be affected by the current adverse market conditions for the steel industry, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. if impairment is determined to exist, we will incur non-cash impairment losses, which will reduce our earnings. tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and specifically nucor business is sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the u.s., nucor is more exposed to the effects of the various forms of tax increases in the u.s. than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations such as certain provisions in the current administration budget proposals and various tax changes under discussion in congress. the proposals with potential adverse effect include, but are not limited to, repealing lifo (last-in, first-out treatment of inventory) and decreasing the ability of u.s. companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the u.s. deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at

rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2009, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials. due to decreased demand for and cost of raw materials, however, the surcharge is impacting our sales prices to a lesser extent than in prior years. through the first three quarters of 2009, our earnings were negatively impacted from accelerated consumption of high-cost iron units purchased prior to the abrupt downturn in economic activity late in 2008. since pig iron has purchase lead times of four to six months from ordering to delivery, dramatically and rapidly reduced sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2008 and through much of 2009 resulted in the accumulation of increased tons of pig iron inventories, primarily at our steel mills, ordered at peak market prices. as of the end of the third quarter of 2009, we had completed the usage of those high cost iron units. the impact on 2009 net 15 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, continued earnings of the high priced raw material inventory overhang was approximately $420.0 million or $0.85 per share after taxes. as a result, we experienced significant improvement in our raw material costs during the fourth quarter of 2009 and expect to continue to see improved margins in 2010. nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2009, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included $74.1 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2009, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 23,949 $ 59,871 aluminum 2,257 5,642 copper 656 1,639 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada and trinidad and its joint ventures in australia and italy. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2009 and 2008 were insignificant.risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business. the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows. although credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us, our customers and suppliers. in particular, there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted. additionally, stricter lending standards have made it more difficult for some firms to access the credit markets. although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities, these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money 5 table of contents on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility. in addition, restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or, in some cases, impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations. their lack of, or limited access to, capital would adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or, in some cases, to pay for our products on a timely basis. long-term unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains at historically high levels and the housing market and non-residential construction market remain depressed. high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products. additionally, non-residential construction, including publicly financed state and municipal projects, has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when faced with stagnant or declining tax revenues and increased operating costs. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the global economic recession of 2008/2009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period, coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions, have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor. these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products, weak end-markets and continued depressed demand, resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results in the last three years. after reporting record net earnings of $1.83 billion in 2008, we reported a net loss of $293.6 million in 2009, the first in the company history. in 2010, we returned to profitability, reporting net income of $134.1 million, but the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products. future economic downturns or a prolonged stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in particular, steel production in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, currently exceeds chinese demand and in recent years the production growth rate has exceeded the growth rate of demand. this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of low-priced, unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. 6 table of contents competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may have a material adverse effect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials, energy, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, composites, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. in 2011, automobile producers must begin complying with new corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes, that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facility in trinidad and acquiring djj in 2008, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, purchase prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could 7 table of contents temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not applicable across the entire steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steelmaking processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses ( ghgs ), and regulation of ghgs, through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor will be affected, both directly and indirectly, if congress passes legislation or the united states environmental protection agency ( usepa ) adopts standards intended to regulate ghg emissions. cap-and-trade legislation designed to curb emissions of ghgs passed in the house of representatives in 2009, but similar legislation failed to pass in the senate in 2010. several states have already adopted, and other states may in the future adopt, legislation or regulations implementing state-wide or in some cases regional cap-and-trade systems that apply to some or all industries that emit ghgs. to the extent that these programs cause an increase in the cost of energy they will have an impact on nucor ability to operate in those regions. the usepa announced in december 2010 a timetable for issuing new rules under the clean air act that will limit ghg emissions from new and refurbished power plants and new oil refineries with target dates of may and november 2012 for adopting final rules. rules for existing plants and refineries would be issued by the epa at an unspecified date thereafter. if the proposed regulations for power generation are adopted in a form that requires deep reductions in ghg emissions, we could incur increased indirect costs to manufacture our products as such regulations would result in an increased cost of the energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges to them, including the authority of the usepa to adopt them, have been resolved, however, we cannot reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. because some foreign steel producers will not be subject to these same indirect cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to ghg regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. in addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the u.s., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural or man-made disasters, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. 8 table of contents our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2010, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $2.61 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results. because of our international expansion efforts, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. generally, each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency, limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions. we monitor our exposures and, from time to time, may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions. in addition to potential transaction losses, our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these long-lived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, we will incur a non-cash impairment loss that will negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the u.s., nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax laws. potential changes that would adversely affect us include, but are not limited to, repealing lifo (last-in, first-out treatment of inventory) and decreasing the ability of u.s. companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the u.s. deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2010, 24% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. the remaining 76% of nucor debt is at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2010, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. nucor utilizes a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials. in periods of stable demand for our products, our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower, however, the surcharge impacts our sales prices to a lesser extent. nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other 14 table of contents comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2010, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included $68.9 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2010, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 9,500 $ 23,600 aluminum 3,492 8,731 copper 1,723 4,308 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada, europe, trinidad and australia. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2010 and 2009 were insignificant.risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business. the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth. 8 although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us, our customers and suppliers. in particular, there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted. additionally, stricter lending standards have made it more difficult for some firms to access the credit markets. although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities, these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility. in addition, restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or, in some cases, impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations. lack of, or limited access to, capital would adversely affect our customers ability to purchase our products or, in some cases, to pay for our products on a timely basis. long-term unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains at historically high levels and the housing market and non-residential construction market remain depressed. high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products. additionally, non-residential construction, including publicly financed state and municipal projects, has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when faced with stagnant or declining tax revenues and increased operating costs. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the global economic recession of 2008/2009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period, coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions, have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor. these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products, weak end-markets and continued depressed demand, resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results since the last up-cycle. in 2009, we reported a net loss of $293.6 million, the first in the company history. we returned to profitability in 2010 and 2011, reporting net income of $134.1 million and $778.2 million, respectively. however, the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of

currently exceeds chinese demand and in recent years the production growth rate has exceeded the growth rate of demand. this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of low-priced, unfairly traded steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. the recent addition of new capacity and expansion or restarting of existing sheet steel production in the united states has exacerbated this issue domestically as well as globally. competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may have a material adverse effect on our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials, energy, labor and capital costs, government

suppliers and customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs, and regulation of ghgs, through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly as ghg regulations are further implemented. because nucor steelmaking operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ), which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and fracking is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. to the extent that these regulations cause an increase in the cost of energy, they will have an impact on nucor ability to compete. the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants. most of these and other related regulations are already, or we expect will shortly be, challenged in court. until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges to them, including the authority of the usepa to adopt them, have been resolved, however, we cannot reliably estimate their impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. because some foreign steel producers will not be subject to these same indirect cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to ghg regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. 11 environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may

economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural or man-made disasters, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2011, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $2.73 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any

from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business. the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth. although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us, our customers and suppliers. in particular, there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted. additionally, stricter lending standards have made it more difficult and costly for some firms to access the credit markets. although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities, these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility. in addition, restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or, in some cases, impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations. lack of, or limited access to, capital would adversely affect our customers ability to purchase our products or, in some cases, to pay for our products on a timely basis. long-term unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains at historically high levels and the housing market and nonresidential construction market remain depressed. high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products. additionally, nonresidential construction, including publicly financed state and municipal projects, has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when their operating expenses are in many cases growing faster than their revenues from taxes and other sources. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the global economic recession of 2008-2009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period, coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions, have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor. these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel products, weak end-markets 8 table of contents and continued depressed demand, resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results since the last up-cycle. in 2009, we reported a net loss of $293.6 million, the first in the company history. although we have since returned to profitability, the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. over capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china, brazil and other countries. in particular, steel production in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, continues to exceed chinese demand. this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. the recent addition of new capacity and expansion or restarting of existing sheet steel production in the united states has exacerbated this issue domestically as well as globally. competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may have a material adverse effect on our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials, energy, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, composites, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. in 2011, automobile producers began taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes, that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although we have vertically integrated our business 9 table of contents by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs. the financial performance and condition of our natural gas drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids. fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs. prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company control. a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties, all of which could have an adverse effect on the company revenues, profitability and cash flows. our steelmaking and dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs, and regulation of ghgs, through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly as ghg regulations are further implemented. because these operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we have already begun to feel the impact in the 10 table of contents permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ), which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. if one of our permits is revoked or if we experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification, we could experience operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. to the extent that these regulations cause an increase in the cost of energy, they will have an impact on nucor ability to compete. the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants. most of these and other related regulations are already, or we expect will shortly be, challenged in court. until all proposed ghg emission regulations are adopted in final form and all legal challenges are resolved, we cannot reliably estimate their full impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. congress has considered legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, and other legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing has been considered, and in some cases adopted, at various levels of government. hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations, including all of those in our drilling program. this process involves the injection of water, chemicals and, at times, sand under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the production of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids. sponsors of these bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and/or that hydraulic fracturing could pose a variety of other risks. any onerous governmental regulations could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and possibly even the cessation of drilling. we plan to continue to implement our acquisition strategy and may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. 11 table of contents in addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the u.s., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural or man-made disasters, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2012, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $3.23 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results. because of our international expansion efforts, we are increasingly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. generally, each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency, limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions. we monitor our exposures and, from time to time, may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions. in addition to potential transaction losses, our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these long-lived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the u.s., nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax laws. potential changes that would adversely affect us include, but are not limited to, current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax expenditures (repealing lifo (last-in, first-out treatment of inventory), accelerated depreciation, and the domestic production activity deduction) and decreasing the ability of u.s. companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the u.s. deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 16 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2012, 28% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. the remaining 72% of nucor debt is at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2012, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. we employ a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to facilitate the passing through of increased costs of scrap steel and other raw materials. in periods of stable demand for our products, our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower, however, the surcharge impacts our sales prices to a lesser extent. our natural gas working interest drilling programs are affected by volatility of natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our steel production and dri facilities. this relationship is part of the value proposition and why these drilling programs serve as a natural hedge to price volatility of the natural gas we use in our steel production and dri facilities. 16 table of contents nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2012, there are no amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative instruments as all of our previously held positions have settled. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2012, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change aluminum $ 1,910 $ 4,774 copper 1,109 2,772 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe, trinidad and colombia. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2012 and 2011 were insignificant.risk factors 8 risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. recovery from the global recession and credit crisis has and likely will continue to adversely affect our business. the continuing economic downturn as a result of the deep global recession that began in the united states in december 2007 and officially ended in june 2009 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows. apprehension about the potential economic consequences of continuing domestic political wrangling over budgetary decisions and debt ceiling limits could negatively impact demand for our products. in addition, uncertainties in europe regarding the financial sector and debt crises and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world will continue to weigh on global and domestic growth. although domestic credit markets have largely stabilized from the height of the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the effects of the financial crisis continue to present additional risks to us, our customers and suppliers. in particular, there is no guarantee that the credit markets or liquidity will not once again be restricted. additionally, stricter lending standards have made it more difficult and costly for some firms to access the credit markets. although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committed borrowings and other available credit facilities, these risks could temporarily restrict our ability to borrow money on acceptable terms in the credit markets and potentially could affect our ability to draw on our credit facility. in addition, restricted access to the credit markets is also continuing to make it difficult or, in some cases, impossible for our customers to borrow money to fund their operations. lack of, or limited access to, capital would adversely affect our customers ability to purchase our products or, in some cases, to pay for our products on a timely basis. long-term unemployment for those unemployed for more than six months remains high and the housing market and nonresidential construction market remain depressed. high unemployment and a weak housing market have an impact on downstream demand for many of our products. additionally, nonresidential construction, including publicly financed state and municipal projects, has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow to spend on capital projects when their operating expenses are in many cases growing faster than their revenues from taxes and other sources. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the global economic recession of 2008-2009 and subsequent anemic economic recovery period, coupled with the lingering effects of the global financial and credit market disruptions, have had a historic negative impact on the steel industry and nucor. these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in pricing for steel and steel 8 table of contents products, weak end-markets and continued depressed demand, resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results since the last up-cycle. in 2009, we reported a net loss of $293.6 million, the first in the company history. although we have since returned to profitability, the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. over capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china, brazil and other countries. in particular, steel production in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, continues to exceed chinese demand. this rising overcapacity in china has the potential to result in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the united states that could put our steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. the recent addition of new capacity and expansion or restarting of existing sheet steel production in the united states has exacerbated this issue domestically as well as globally. competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials, energy, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, composites, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. certain automakers have announced that they will use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some 2015 models that will be available next year. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although we have vertically integrated our 9 table of contents business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material,

an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials, although we have successfully used a raw material surcharge in the steel mills segment since 2004. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs. the financial performance and condition of our natural gas drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids. fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs. prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company control. a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in further delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties, all of which could have an adverse effect on the company revenues, profitability and cash flows. our steelmaking and dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs, and regulation of ghgs, through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon

impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we, accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. various legislative efforts, at all levels, are in process that are intended to further regulate the hydraulic fracturing process used by the oil and gas industry. hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations, including all of those in our working interest natural gas drilling program. this process involves the injection of water, chemicals and, at times, sand under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the production of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids. sponsors of these proposals and regulations have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and/or that hydraulic fracturing could pose a variety of other risks. any onerous governmental regulations could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and possibly even the cessation of drilling. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. 11 table of contents in addition, we may enter into joint ventures or acquisitions located outside the u.s., which may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations, changes in economic conditions and changes in local government regulations and policies. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, unplanned critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2013, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $3.44 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. changes in foreign currency may adversely affect our financial results. because of our international expansion efforts, we are increasingly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. generally, each of our foreign operations both produces and sells in its local currency, limiting our exposure to foreign currency transactions. we monitor our exposures and, from time to time, may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions. in addition to potential transaction losses, our reported results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these long-lived assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the u.s., nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax laws. potential changes that would adversely affect us include, but are not limited to, current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax expenditures (repealing lifo (last-in, first-out treatment of inventory), accelerated depreciation, and the domestic production activity deduction) and decreasing the ability of u.s. companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the u.s. deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries. 12 table of contents we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks. we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with governmental safety and environmental regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, environmental, employment, intellectual property, contractual and governmental matters, that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see item 3. legal proceedings. a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 16 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2013, 24% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. the remaining 76% of nucor debt is at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2013, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. nucor utilizes a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials. in periods of stable demand for our products, our surcharge mechanism has worked effectively to reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for and cost of raw materials is lower, however, the surcharge benefits our sales prices to a lesser extent. natural gas produced by nucor working interest drilling program is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility. in addition to its future natural gas needs at the new dri facility that began operations in the fourth quarter of 2013, nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations. we expect that the natural gas produced through the drilling 16 table of contents program will be sufficient to cover nucor demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or, alternatively, at three dri plants. however, the natural gas production from the working interest drilling program currently does not completely cover the natural gas usage at our operating facilities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the volume of natural gas sold from our natural gas working interest drilling program was approximately 73% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities. our natural gas working interest drilling program is affected by changes in natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our dri and steel mill operations. as natural gas prices increase, our increased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations is somewhat mitigated by increased profit from sales of natural gas to third party customers from our natural gas drilling program. likewise, as natural gas prices decrease, we experience decreased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations, but we also experience decreased profit from our natural gas drilling program. the impact of low natural gas prices associated with our drilling program is limited by the existence of a drilling suspension clause. nucor is contractually obligated to drill a minimum number of wells per year under the terms of our original agreements with encana; however, we have the right to suspend drilling of new wells at any time after january 1, 2015, if market pricing falls below a pre-established threshold. in the fourth quarter of 2013, nucor and encana agreed to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells. this joint decision was made due to the current weak natural gas pricing environment. this pause demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to market conditions to the mutual benefit of both parties while still allowing us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility at our operating divisions that consume natural gas. nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time primarily to partially manage our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process as well as scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2013, there were no amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative instruments as all of our previously held positions have settled. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2013, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 838 $ 2,095 aluminum 1,011 2,527 copper 1,337 3,342 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe, trinidad and colombia. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2013 and 2012 were insignificant.risk factors 8 risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. five years removed from the worst recession the united states has experienced in decades, we have begun to see some improvement in general economic and manufacturing activity. however, the slow pace of recovery, coupled with ongoing uncertainties in europe and other regions of the world, continue to weigh on global and domestic growth. these situations continue to contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand, resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results. although we experienced increased profitability in 2014 from the previous year, the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products compared to pre-recession levels. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and 8 table of contents domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china, brazil and other countries. in particular, steel production in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, continues to exceed chinese demand. this rising overcapacity in china has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the united states and world steel markets. steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers could then be displaced into global markets, putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. producers in the world steel market could pursue additional export opportunities as a result of the current abundance of ocean freight capacity and lower fuel costs. however, the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the u.s. dollar against other foreign currencies. furthermore, the planned addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally. competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and availability, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, composites, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some 2015 and 2016 models. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although we have further vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap demands of our global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our 9 table of contents markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs. the financial performance and condition of our natural gas working interest drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids. fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs. prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company control. a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in further delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties, all of which could have an adverse effect on the company revenues, profitability and cash flows. our steelmaking processes, dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs. the regulation of these ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if ghg regulations are further implemented. because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ), which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal 10 table of contents thereby reducing their emissions significantly. however, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, they will have an impact on nucor ability to compete. the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants. court challenges regarding many of these regulations have diminished to some extent their impact on various operations. nucor operations have not, however, experienced any relief from these legal actions. further court challenges to some of the naaqs revisions may affect our operations, but the impact is likely to be minimal. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. various legislative efforts, at all levels, are in process that are intended to further regulate the hydraulic fracturing process used by the oil and gas industry. hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations, including all of those in our natural gas working interest drilling programs. this process involves the injection of water, chemicals and, at times, sand under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the release of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids. sponsors of these proposals and regulations have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and/or that hydraulic fracturing could pose a variety of other risks. the practitioners of fracking are adamant that these claims are false and to date the usepa has not attempted to further regulate the practice. any onerous governmental regulations could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and possibly even the cessation of drilling. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. 11 table of contents our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, unplanned critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business. we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. while decentralization tends to compartmentalize exposure, these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our results of operations. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2014, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $3.61 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources. risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. certain of our businesses are located outside of the united states, in europe and in emerging markets. there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. these include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977. these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. 12 table of contents tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the u.s., nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax laws. potential changes that would adversely affect us include, but are not limited to, current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax deductions [repealing lifo (last-in, first-out treatment of inventory), accelerated depreciation, and the domestic production activity deduction] and decrease the ability of u.s. companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the u.s. deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries. we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks. we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see item 3. legal proceedings. a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor

through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. natural gas produced by nucor working interest drilling programs is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility. in addition to the future natural gas needs at the louisiana dri facility that began operations in the fourth quarter of 2013, nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations. natural gas produced through the working interest drilling programs is expected to be sufficient in the future to cover nucor demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or, alternatively, at three dri plants. however, 17 table of contents the natural gas production from the working interest drilling programs currently does not completely cover the natural gas usage at our operating facilities due to the temporary cessation of drilling discussed below. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the volume of natural gas sold from our natural gas working interest drilling programs was approximately 66% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities. our natural gas working interest drilling programs are affected by changes in natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our dri and steel mill operations. as natural gas prices increase, our increased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations is somewhat mitigated by increased profit from sales of natural gas to third party customers from our natural gas drilling programs. likewise, as natural gas prices decrease, we experience decreased

encana; however, we have the right to suspend drilling of new wells if market pricing falls below a pre-established threshold. in the fourth quarter of 2013, we announced a joint decision with encana to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells until there is a sustained improvement in natural gas pricing. in the fourth quarter of 2014 nucor and encana agreed to further suspend drilling through calendar year 2015, except for a de minimis number of wells that are necessary in order to retain leasehold rights. we believe that this pause demonstrates the flexibility of our partnership with encana to react to market conditions to the mutual benefit of both parties while still allowing us to better manage our exposure to natural gas pricing volatility at our operating divisions that consume natural gas. nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2014, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included $8.0 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2014, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 5,600 $ 13,900 aluminum 2,061 5,153 copper 76 190 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe and trinidad. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2014 and 2013 were insignificant.risk factors 8 risk factors for more information about the potential impact of ghg regulations on nucor business. the cwa regulates water discharges and withdrawals. nucor maintains discharge and withdrawal permits as appropriate at its facilities under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and conducts its operations in compliance with those permits. nucor also maintains permits from local governments for the discharge of water into publicly owned treatment works where available. rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. rcra also addresses the environmental impact of contamination from waste disposal activities and from recycling of and storage of most wastes. while nucor believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations, past waste disposal activities that were legal when conducted but now may pose a contamination threat are periodically discovered. these activities and off-site properties that usepa has determined are contaminated, for which nucor may be potentially responsible at some level, are quickly evaluated and corrected. while nucor has conducted and is in the final stages of completing some cleanups under rcra, these liabilities either are identified already and being resolved or have been fully resolved. because nucor long ago implemented environmental practices that have resulted in the responsible disposal of waste materials, nucor is also not presently considered a major contributor to any major cleanups under cercla for which nucor has been named a potentially responsible party. nucor continually evaluates these types of potential liabilities and, if appropriate, maintains reserves sufficient to remediate the identified liabilities. under rcra, private citizens may also bring an action against the operator of a regulated facility for potential damages and payment of cleanup costs. nucor is confident that its system of internal evaluation and due diligence has sufficiently identified these types of potential liabilities so that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition beyond that already reflected in the reserves established for them. the primary raw material of nucor steelmaking operations is scrap metal. the process of recycling scrap metal brings with it many contaminants such as paint, zinc, chrome and other metals that produce air emissions which are captured in specialized emission control equipment. this filtrant (eaf dust) is classified as a listed hazardous waste under the rcra. because these contaminants contain valuable metals, this filtrant is recycled to recover those metals. nucor sends all but a small fraction of the eaf dust it produces to recycling facilities that recover the zinc, lead, chrome and other valuable metals from this dust. by recycling this material, nucor is not only acting in a sustainable, responsible manner but is also substantially limiting its potential for future liability under both cercla and rcra. nucor operates an aggressive and sustainable environmental program that incorporates the concept of individual employee as well as management responsibility for environmental performance. all of nucor steelmaking operations are iso 14001 certified. achieving iso 14001 certification means that each of nucor steel mills has put an environmental management system in place with measurable targets and objectives, such as reducing the use of oil and grease and minimizing electricity use, and has implemented site-wide recycling programs. these environmental management systems make environmental commitment each nucor teammate responsibility. nucor environmental program maintains a high level of ongoing training, commitment, outreach and visibility. 7 table of contents capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2016 and 2017 are estimated to be less than $100 million per year. employees nucor has a simple, streamlined organizational structure to allow our employees to make quick decisions and to innovate. our organization is highly decentralized, with most day-to-day operating decisions made by our division general managers and their staff. we have slightly more than 100 employees in our executive office. the vast majority of nucor approximately 23,700 employees are not represented by labor unions. available information nucor annual report on

factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the united states economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. while the united states has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world, the global and domestic steel industries continue to face significant challenges. these challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world. these situations can contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products, potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results. the economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products well below the 2007 pre-recession levels. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and 8 table of contents domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china, brazil and other countries. in particular, steel production in china, the world largest producer and consumer of steel, continues to exceed chinese demand. according to the china iron &amp; steel association, china total annual crude steel capacity is 1.2 billion metric tons, while chinese apparent steel demand was only 645 million metric tons in the first 11 months of 2015. this rising overcapacity and slowdown in demand in china has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the united states and world steel markets. steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers could then be displaced into global markets, putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. producers in the world steel market could pursue additional export opportunities as a result of the current abundance of ocean freight capacity and lower fuel costs. furthermore, the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the u.s. dollar against other foreign currencies. furthermore, the planned addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally. competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and availability, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, composites, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although we have further vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and 9 table of contents regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. a substantial or extended decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our natural gas working interest drilling programs. the financial performance and condition of our natural gas working interest drilling programs are substantially dependent on the prevailing prices of natural gas and liquids. fluctuations in natural gas or liquids prices could have an adverse effect on the company natural gas operations and financial condition and the value and recovery of its reserves in the working interest drilling programs. prices for natural gas and liquids fluctuate in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company control. a substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas could result in further delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling programs or curtailment in production at some properties, all of which could have an adverse effect on the company revenues, profitability and cash flows. our steelmaking processes, dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs. the regulation of these ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor will be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if ghg regulations are further implemented. because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we have already begun to feel the impact in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated naaqs, which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic 10 table of contents fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. however, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. the usepa has recently finalized its cpp, but there are ongoing legal challenges to that regulation. these are regulations intended to reduce ghgs from electric generating units. the increase in electric costs will vary on a state by state basis but will be substantial across all regions. some states are expected to see increases in excess of 50% for ratepayers. there will be many legal challenges to these new regulations, but the reality is that utility companies are making decisions today that will increase cost because of uncertainty of the outcome of any legal challenges. to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, they will have an impact on nucor competitive position. the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants. court challenges regarding many of these regulations have diminished to some extent their impact on various operations. nucor operations have not, however, experienced any relief from these legal actions. further court challenges to some of the naaqs revisions may affect our operations, but the impact is likely to be minimal. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. the usepa has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials. increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, unplanned critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. 11 table of contents we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business. we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel and therefore affect our results of operations. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2015, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $4 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources. risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states, in europe and in emerging markets. there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. these risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977. these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the united states, nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax 12 table of contents laws. potential changes that would adversely affect us include, but are not limited to, current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates and eliminate most tax deductions [repealing lifo (last-in, first-out treatment of inventory), accelerated depreciation, and the domestic production activity deduction] and decrease the ability of u.s. companies to receive a tax credit for foreign taxes paid or to defer the u.s. deduction of expenses in connection with investments made in other countries. we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks. we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see item 3. legal proceedings. a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. 17 table of contents interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2015, 23% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. the remaining 77% of nucor long-term debt was at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2015, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. in periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. natural gas produced by nucor working interest drilling programs is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility. in addition to the natural gas needs at the louisiana dri facility, nucor is also a substantial consumer of natural gas at our steel mill operations. dependent on future natural gas pricing, natural gas produced through the working interest drilling programs is expected to be sufficient to cover nucor current demand at all of its steel mills in the united states plus the demand of two dri plants or, alternatively, at three dri plants. however, the natural gas production from the working interest drilling programs currently does not completely cover the natural gas usage at our operating facilities due to the temporary suspension of drilling discussed below. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the volume of natural gas sold from our working interest drilling programs was approximately 54% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities. our natural gas working interest drilling programs are affected by changes in natural gas prices in an inverse manner to natural gas costs at our dri and steel mill operations. as natural gas prices increase, our increased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations is somewhat mitigated by increased profit from sales of natural gas to third party customers from our working interest drilling programs. likewise, as natural gas prices decrease, we experience decreased energy costs at our dri and steel mill operations, but we also experience decreased profit from our working interest drilling programs. the impact of low natural gas prices associated with our working interest drilling programs is limited by the existence of a drilling suspension clause. nucor is contractually obligated to drill a minimum number of wells per year under the terms of our original agreements with encana; however, we have the right to suspend drilling of new wells if market pricing falls below a pre-established threshold. in the fourth quarter of 2013, nucor and encana agreed to temporarily suspend drilling new natural gas wells until there is a sustained improvement in natural gas pricing. 18 table of contents nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included $11.7 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2015, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 3,699 $ 9,247 aluminum 1,149 2,872 copper 179 447 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe and trinidad. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant.risk factors 8 risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these 8 table of contents imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china, brazil and other countries. according to the american iron and steel institute, global steel overcapacity is estimated at approximately 770 million tons per year, with china overcapacity being the largest piece at approximately 470 million tons. this overcapacity and the slowdown in demand in china have resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the united states and world steel markets. steel and steel products which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers could then be displaced into global markets, putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage. a continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in china rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel exports from china. producers in the world steel market could pursue additional export opportunities as a result of the current abundance of ocean freight capacity. furthermore, the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the u.s. dollar against other foreign currencies. furthermore, the addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the u.s. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. while the united states has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world, the global and domestic steel industries continue to face significant challenges. these challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world. these situations can contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products, potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results. the economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products well below the 2007 pre-recession levels. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. competition from other producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and availability, energy,

forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, composites, plastic and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. 9 table of contents since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the

may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steelmaking processes, dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs. the regulation of these ghgs through new regulations or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent ghg regulations are further 10 table of contents implemented. because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national air ambient quality standards ( naaqs ), which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. however, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. the usepa has recently finalized its cpp, but that regulation is currently undergoing judicial review. these are regulations intended to reduce ghgs from electric generating units. the increase in electric costs will vary on a state by state basis but could be substantial across all regions. although the rule is stayed pending a final court decision, utility companies are making decisions today that will likely increase cost for energy purchasers. to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, they could have an impact on nucor competitive position. the usepa continues to press forward with new regulations that control ghg and other naaqs pollutants. court challenges regarding many of these regulations have diminished to some extent their impact on various operations. further court challenges to some of the naaqs revisions may affect our operations, but the impact is likely to be minimal. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. currently, there is uncertainty as to the future of these regulations given the change in administration in washington. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. the usepa has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials. increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. 11 table of contents our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, unplanned critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business. we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel and therefore affect our results of operations. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2016, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $4 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources. risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states, in europe and in emerging markets. there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. these risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977. these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. 12 table of contents tax increases and changes in tax rules could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the united states, nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax laws. potential changes that would adversely affect us include, but are not limited to, current proposals for corporate tax reform which would lower tax rates, eliminate many tax deductions (accelerated depreciation, interest expense, and the domestic production activity deduction) and create border adjustments eliminating deduction of inputs from foreign sources. we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks. we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see item 3. legal proceedings. a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2016, 23% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. the remaining 77% of nucor long-term debt was at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2016, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. in periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production. natural gas produced by nucor drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 28% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities. 17 table of contents nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2016, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included $0.8 million in unrealized net-of-tax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2016, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 5,800 $ 14,510 aluminum 1,272 2,943 copper 1,099 3,892 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe and trinidad. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2016 and 2015 were insignificant.risk factors 8 risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 8 table of contents overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. during periods of global economic weakness this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overcapacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by china, brazil and other countries. the g-20 global forum on steel excess capacity, citing data from the organisation for economic co-operation &amp; development and the world steel association, reports that in 2016 global steel production overcapacity was estimated at approximately 812,000,000 tons per year, with china being the largest contributor to overcapacity. total steel imports into the united states increased more than 15% in 2017 compared to the prior year. excess capacity results in steel and steel products, which would otherwise have been consumed by the local steel customers, being displaced into global markets and thereby putting our steel and steel products at a competitive disadvantage. the domestic steel market could experience a contraction in exports at the same time as imports grow due to weakening conditions in europe and policies of foreign governments that result in overvaluing the u.s. dollar against other foreign currencies. furthermore, the addition of new capacity in the united states could exacerbate the issue of overcapacity domestically as well as globally. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the u.s. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. while the united states has recently experienced modest growth in the general economy and steel demand in this country is stronger than in many parts of the world, the global and domestic steel industries continue to face significant challenges. these challenges are caused by global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world. these situations can contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand for domestically produced steel and steel products, potentially resulting in extraordinary volatility in our financial results. the economic outlook for our industry remains uncertain both in the united states and globally. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for domestically produced steel and steel products below the 2007 pre-recession levels. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. competition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and 9 table of contents availability, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over-supply of steel in north america. certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our products. although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 10 table of contents our steelmaking processes, dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs. the regulation of these ghgs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent ghg regulations are further implemented. because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national air ambient quality standards, which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is dampening some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. however, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. the epa has recently announced that it will be replacing the previously promulgated clean power plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants. at this time there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction. to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, they could have an impact on nucor competitive position. while the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations, some states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other ghg emissions. if such regulations are enacted in states in which nucor does business, it could negatively affect those operations. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and we accordingly, make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. the epa has recently revised the rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials. increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions 11 table of contents will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, unplanned critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach, including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2017, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $3.3 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources. risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states, in europe, mexico and in emerging markets. there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. these risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977. these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing 12 table of contents for potential impairment may be adversely affected by the continuing uncertain market conditions for the steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results. the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 significantly affected the way u.s.-based multinational companies are taxed. nucor expects to benefit from the act domestic corporate tax law changes which will decrease the company effective tax rate and cash tax liabilities. the international portions of the act, which transition the u.s. tax regime from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and provide for u.s. tax on certain types of foreign income, may cause tax increases on the company foreign operations. it is unclear the extent to which u.s. states will change their rates and tax base in response to the tax cuts and jobs act, but changes could adversely affect our financial results. we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks. we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see item 3. legal proceedings. a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2017, approximately 27% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. the remaining 73% of nucor long-term debt was at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2017, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. in periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production. 17 table of contents natural gas produced by nucor drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 21% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities. nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2017, accumulated other comprehensive loss included $2.8 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2017, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 15,640 $ 39,110 aluminum 3,657 9,164 copper 4,088 10,261 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe and mexico. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2017 and 2016 were insignificant.risk factors 8 risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the current global steelmaking capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development, global steel production overcapacity was approximately 600 million tons at the end of 2017, with nearly half that amount located in china. overcapacity is down from its peak in 2015 and 2016. efforts by china to close inefficient steel production and improve air quality, steel mill closures in europe and stronger global economic growth all contributed to reduce excess capacity. during periods of global economic weakness, this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates, and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. section 232 steel tariffs are keeping dumped steel products out of the u.s. market. international efforts to reduce global steel production overcapacity, such as the g-20 global forum on steel excess capacity, are 8 table of contents ongoing. the u.s. government is also negotiating new or renegotiating existing trade agreements, which provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity. should these efforts fail to reduce excess capacity and the section 232 tariffs be lifted, u.s. steelmakers would be at risk of having to compete again against steel products dumped in the u.s. market. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the u.s. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. general economic conditions in the united states and steel demand in this country are currently stronger than in many parts of the world, but challenges from global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties in other regions of the world remain. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions. future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. competition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and availability, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel in north america. certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products. the raw material required to produce dri is pelletized iron ore. although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors. at any given 9 table of contents time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions, including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steelmaking processes, our dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other ghgs. the regulation of these ghgs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent ghg regulations are further implemented. because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and recently promulgated national air ambient quality standards, which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is mitigating some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. however, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. in 2018, the epa proposed the affordable clean energy rule to replace the promulgated clean power plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants. however, there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction. to the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, they could have an impact on nucor competitive position. 10 table of contents while the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations, some states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other ghg emissions. if such regulations are enacted in states in which nucor does business, it could negatively affect those operations. numerous states, including california, washington, oregon and new york, are considering or have passed laws using environmental product declarations ( epd ) to evaluate environmental impacts of products. the impacts identified by epds could impact future state/consumer purchasing decisions. california has implemented the buy clean california act and california is currently requesting epds from manufacturers to be used in state of california funded projects. epds will be required for certain materials including some steel products after january 1, 2020. global warming potentials ( gwp ) will be established by january 1, 2021 for applicable product categories and epds will be used to determine product compliance to the gwp limits. because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and accordingly, we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these estimates. nucor has implemented the revised epa rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials. increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the united states to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance. we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as 11 table of contents intellectual property and proprietary business information. despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach, including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2018, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $3.1 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds, short-term commercial paper issuance or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources. risks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states, in europe, mexico and in emerging markets. there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. these risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws, and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977. these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the united states, nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax laws. 12 table of contents we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks. we spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. for information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see item 3. legal proceedings. a negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. we continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. 17 table of contents interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. at december 31, 2018, approximately 24% of nucor long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. the remaining 76% of nucor long-term debt was at fixed rates. future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. as of december 31, 2018, there were no such contracts outstanding. nucor investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. as a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments. commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business, nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. in periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. when demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. dri is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production. natural gas produced by nucor drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 15% of the volume of natural gas purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and dri facilities. nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. at december 31, 2018, accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes included $6.5 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. the following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december 31, 2018, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands): commodity derivative 10% change 25% change natural gas $ 11,768 $ 29,420 aluminum 4,370 10,905 copper 724 1,770 any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities. foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in canada, europe and mexico. we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31, 2018 and 2017 were insignificantrisk factors 12 risk factors many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 12 table of contents overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the current global steelmaking capacity significantly exceeds the current global consumption of steel. according to the oecd, global steel production overcapacity was approximately 485 million tons at the halfway point of 2019, with a quarter of that amount located in china. overcapacity is down from its peak in 2015 and 2016. efforts by china to close inefficient steel production and improve air quality, steel mill closures in europe and stronger global economic growth all contributed to reduce excess capacity. during periods of global economic weakness, this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand. this excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. in some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. these imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates, and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. section 232 steel tariffs are keeping dumped steel products out of the u.s. market. the u.s. government is also negotiating new or renegotiating existing trade agreements with many countries, including china, which provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity. should these efforts fail to reduce excess capacity and the section 232 tariffs be lifted, u.s. steelmakers would be at risk of having to compete again against steel products dumped in the u.s. market. our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business. demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. as a result, downturns in the u.s. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. general economic conditions in the united states and steel demand in this country are currently stronger than in many parts of the world, but challenges from global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties, both in the united states and in other regions of the world, remain. while we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions. future economic downturns or prolonged slow-growth or a stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. competition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business. we face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price, quality and service. the steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel, steel products and raw materials markets. depending on a variety of factors, including the cost and availability of raw materials, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces. in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products. since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. 13 table of contents as automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may seek to reduce the amount of steel they incorporate in their vehicles or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing their demand for steel. certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015. the results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel. we rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products. the raw material required to produce dri is pelletized iron ore. although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our dri facilities in trinidad and louisiana and also acquiring djj in 2008, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the united states. although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors, as well as currency fluctuations. at any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. this trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the u.s. market. if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. in addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. this could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation. changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business. our steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. in addition, our dri facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. the prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. these market conditions often are affected by weather, political, regulatory and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. disruptions, including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our steelmaking processes, our dri processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases ( ghgs ). the regulation of these ghgs through significant new rulemaking or legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. carbon is an essential raw material in nucor's production processes. as a carbon steel producer, nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent domestic ghg 14 table of contents regulations are further implemented. because our operations are subject to most of these new ghg regulations, we are already impacted in the permit modification and reporting processes. both ghg regulations and national air ambient quality standards, which are more restrictive than previous standards, can make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing permits. these same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. the discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is mitigating some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. however, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can lead to increased electrical energy prices. in 2019, the epa issued its affordable clean energy (ace) rule to replace the promulgated clean power plan that was driving many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants. while this is expected to result in lower electric power costs in the united states, another change in regulatory approach due to political or other considerations could cause, either directly or indirectly an increase in the cost of energy, adversely impacting nucor's competitive position. while the federal government has moved in recent years to relax some regulations that can impact domestic energy costs, some states are moving to enact their own regulations to curtail carbon and other ghg emissions. if such regulations are enacted in states in which nucor does business, it could increase our costs there. numerous states, including california, washington, oregon and new york, are considering or have passed laws using environmental product declarations ( epds ) to evaluate environmental impacts of products. california has implemented the buy clean california act and california is currently requesting epds from manufacturers to be used in state of california funded projects. epds are now required for certain materials including some steel products. global warming potentials ( gwp ) will be established by january 1, 2021 for applicable product categories and epds will be used to determine product compliance to the gwp limits. the impacts identified by epds could impact future state/consumer purchasing decisions. in addition to increased costs of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to these regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment. we are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches of our systems or those of our third-party service providers. these risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information, personal data, reputational damage or could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. we also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach, including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems. we may also contend with potential liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums. our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. the steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. while our insurance coverage could offset a portion of the losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent that any such losses are not covered by our insurance, or that there are significant delays in resolving our claims with our insurance providers. 15 table of contents environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position. our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and accordingly, we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates. nucor has implemented revised epa rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. the new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling materials. we have incurred increased administrative and operational costs to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. to the extent that competitors, particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. if one of our permits is revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. we acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire. we plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen nucor. realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses. our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements. our operations are capital intensive. for the five-year period ended december 31, 2019, our total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $4.0 billion. our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for

could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. certain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the united states, in europe, mexico and in emerging markets. there are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. these risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors local labor and social issues changes in regulatory requirements fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws, and the united states foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 (fcpa). these risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. 16 table of contents the accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. we periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. the results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates, commodity prices and general economic conditions. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations. tax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results. the steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. as a company based in the united states, nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in u.s. tax laws than some of our major competitors. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in u.s. tax

our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our louisiana dri facility and our steel mills in the united states. nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same
