risk factors 2 risk factors global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position. our business and financial performance are impacted by global economic conditions. in 2011, the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand. however, europe continued to experience economic difficulty and the economic conditions in europe continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis. if the economic conditions worsen, the downturn may expand beyond europe and could cause reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client spending and other factors, and in response to reductions in client spending, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. there can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in client spending patterns, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective. 2 conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. if that were to occur, we may require additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. in a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase. in the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed the revenue from our services. many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. the media commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients' creditworthiness and, in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. in addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. however, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. a reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital. global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. the markets we operate in are highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. further, as our business continues to become integrated with the digital marketplace, we are increasingly dependent on the technical skills of a highly skilled workforce and their ability to maintain the skills necessary to serve our clients. 3 approximately 50% of our 2011 revenue came from our 100 largest clients, and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to outages, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. while we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent outages or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our reputation or business. government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future. government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. the risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, do not affect domestic-focused firms. these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position. for financial information on our operations by geographic area, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include: slower payment of invoices; social, political and economic instability; and foreign exchange controls. in addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and frequently changed. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. 4 holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase up to $660 million of notes, in whole or in part, on specific dates in the future. on july 31, 2012 , $252.7 million of our convertible notes due july 31, 2032 , or the 2032 notes, may be put back to us for repurchase and on june 17, 2013 , $406.6 million of our convertible notes due july 1, 2038 , or the 2038 notes, may be put back to us for repurchase. if our convertible notes are put back to us, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the repurchases. we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our $2.5 billion credit agreement, or credit agreement, to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase. however, in the event that availability under our credit agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we may need to seek additional funding. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms, if at all. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor's rating service, or s&amp;p, rates our long-term debt bbb+ and moody's investors service, or moody's, rates our long-term debt baa1 . our short-term debt ratings are a2 , and p2 by the respective agencies. our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and credit agreement do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. however, the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. furthermore, the 2032 notes and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2032 notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by s&amp;p, or baa3 or lower by moody's or in the case of the 2038 notes to bbb- or lower by s&amp;p, and ba1 or lower by moody's. these events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder's right to cause us to repurchase the notes. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. goodwill may become impaired. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. although our businesses may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other requirements to reduce emissions, we could be in the future. however, we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. in the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes. we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. for foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. for interest rate exposure, derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt. as a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on credit ratings and other factors. we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk analysis. value-at-risk is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments. the value-at-risk analysis on our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2011 indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to u.s. dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 21 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, revenue and the expenses associated with that revenue are denominated in the same currency. this minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates has on our results of operations. while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union, or the emu, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china, and japan. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. in certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency. to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with third party banks. at december 31, 2011, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $120.8 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these intercompany borrowings and investments. also, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and operating expenses are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in 26 the foreign currency market with forward contracts. at december 31, 2011, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $71.6 million related to these activities. the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. as a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. interest rate risk from time to time, we issue debt in the capital markets. in 2011, to manage our overall interest cost, we used interest rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt and designated the swaps as a fair value hedge. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps. at december 31, 2011, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes then outstanding on specific dates in the future. the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us is july 31, 2012 and the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes can put the notes back to us is june 17, 2013. as we have done on prior occasions, we may offer a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to the noteholders to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us. if we decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount offered would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including the price of our common stock, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. if our outstanding convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase. although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of operations after the repurchase. additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. the extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio. if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as ebitda to interest expense. however, the coverage ratios in the credit agreement and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to increase 75% or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business, we grant credit to qualified clients. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 2.6% of our 2011 revenue and no other client accounted for more than 2.1% of our 2011 revenue. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation, then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients' creditworthiness and in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. in addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. we manage the risk 27 of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. however, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients. however, the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn.risk factors 2 risk factors global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position. global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. in particular, current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services. in 2012, the united states experienced modest economic growth and the major economies of asia and latin america continued to expand. however, the continuing fiscal issues faced by many countries in the euro zone has caused economic difficulty in certain of our euro zone markets. if economic conditions in these markets do not improve, the demand for our services could be further reduced. if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. there can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective. 2 in a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase. in the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from

liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. however, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn. such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. a reduction in client spending or a delay in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital. global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. the markets we operate in are highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, including highly skilled technically proficient personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. approximately 52% of our 2012 revenue came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial position. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 3 we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. while we have taken prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business. government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. the risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, do not affect domestic-focused firms. these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position. for financial information on our operations by geographic region, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include: slower payment of invoices; social, political and economic instability and foreign exchange controls. in addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and frequently changed. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. if that were to occur, we may require additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. 4 holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase approximately $660 million of notes, in whole or in part, on specific dates in the future. on june 15, 2013 , $406.6 million of our convertible notes due july 1, 2038 , or the 2038 notes, may be put back to us for repurchase and on july 31, 2013 , $252.7 million of our convertible notes due july 31, 2032 , or the 2032 notes, may be put back to us for repurchase. if our convertible notes are put back to us, we expect to have sufficient

our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any repurchase. however, in the event that availability under our credit agreement or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we may need to seek additional funding. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms, if at all. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor's rating service, or s&amp;p, rates our long-term debt bbb+ and moody's investors service, or moody's, rates our long-term debt baa1 . our short-term debt ratings are a2

downgrade. however, the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. furthermore, the 2032 notes and 2038 notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2032 notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by s&amp;p, or baa3 or lower by moody's or in the case of the 2038 notes to bbb- or lower by s&amp;p,

acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. our goodwill may become impaired, which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other requirements to reduce emissions; but, our businesses could be in the future. however, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. in the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes. we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. for foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. for interest rate exposure, derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt. as a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk analysis, or var. var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2012 was not material. because we use foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. foreign exchange risk our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to u.s. dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, revenue and the expenses associated with that revenue are denominated in the same currency. this minimizes the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations. while our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union, or the emu, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china, and japan, our agencies conduct business in more than 50 different currencies. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. in certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency. to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we use forward foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2012 , we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $181.5 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities. 26 also, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts. at december 31, 2012 , we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $63.6 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities. by using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. interest rate risk from time to time, we issue debt in the capital markets. in prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost. at december 31, 2012 , there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. on june 15, 2013 , $406.6 million of our 2038 notes may be put back to us for repurchase and on july 31, 2013 , $252.7 million of our 2032 notes may be put back to us for repurchase. as we have done on prior occasions, we may offer a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to the noteholders to induce them not to put their notes to us. if we decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount offered would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the put date, including the price of our common stock, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. if our convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any repurchase. although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit agreement to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of operations after the repurchase. additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. the extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that is refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our leverage ratio or our debt to capital ratio. if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our interest coverage ratio. however, the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio are currently well within the covenant thresholds. if either our leverage ratio was to increase 40% or our interest coverage ratio was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. therefore, based on our current ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in the interest coverage ratio and reduction in the leverage ratio would still place us comfortably above the covenant requirements. credit risk we provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business, we grant credit to qualified clients. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 2.6% of our 2012 revenue and no other client accounted for more than 2.6% of our 2012 revenue. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation, then we are not liable to the media providers under the theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients' creditworthiness and, in many cases, obtaining credit insurance or requiring payment in advance. further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. in addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance from our client. however, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred, are unique to each client. we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or production costs incurred on behalf of our clients. however, the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in a severe economic downturn. 27risk factors 3 risk factors our entry into the business combination agreement with publicis may have adverse impacts. in order to complete the business combination with publicis, customary closing conditions must be satisfied, including receipt of approvals by governmental regulators and authorities, including approvals under applicable competition laws, approval by our and publicis shareholders of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement, the listing of the publicis omnicom group shares on the applicable stock exchanges, and the absence of a material adverse effect on either our business or the publicis business. it is not certain that these conditions will be met or waived, that we and publicis will be able to obtain the necessary approvals, or that we will be able to resolve all open issues, complexities and challenges necessary to consummate successfully the business combination as provided for under the business combination agreement, or at all. we face risks and uncertainties due both to the pendency of the business combination as well as the potential failure to consummate the business combination, including: we may not realize any or all of the potential benefits combining the businesses of omnicom and publicis; even if the business combination is not consummated, we will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting, and other costs relating to the business combination; we may have to pay a termination fee of $500 million in cash to publicis under some circumstances if the business combination agreement is terminated before we complete the business combination; the pending business combination could have an adverse impact on our relationships with employees, clients and suppliers, and prospective clients or other third parties may delay or decline entering into agreements with us as a result of the announcement of the proposed business combination; and the attention of our management and employees may be diverted from our day-to-day operations. the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business and cash flows, results of operations and financial position. 3 global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position. global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. in particular, current global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising and marketing services which could reduce the demand for our services. if domestic or global economic conditions worsen or do not improve, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client revenue levels and other factors and, in response to reductions in our client revenue, if necessary, we will take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital. there can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective. a reduction in client spending, a delay in client payments or conditions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our working capital. global economic uncertainty, turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for businesses, including us, to meet their working capital requirements and could lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us, and could cause our clients to reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. we could need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements in such circumstances. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable. in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. in addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies' contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services. where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn. companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. the markets we operate in are highly competitive and are expected to remain so. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, the retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. 4 our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, including highly skilled technically proficient personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. approximately 51% of our revenue in 2013 came from our 100 largest clients and the loss of several of these clients could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. while we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business. government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. any limitation on the scope or content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. such actions by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. additionally, government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position and liquidity. we face a number of risks normally associated with a global service business. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. we also must comply with applicable u.s. local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. for financial information on our operations by geographic region, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 5 we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries and high-growth markets. we conduct business in numerous developing countries and high-growth markets around the world. our operations outside the united states are also exposed to risks that include: slower receipt of payments; social, political and economic instability, currency fluctuation and currency repatriation restrictions. in addition, commercial laws in developing countries and high-growth markets can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced or frequently changed. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in countries and markets where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries and markets could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor's rating service, or s&amp;p, rates our long-term debt bbb+ and moody's investors service, or moody's, rates our long-term debt baa1 . our short-term debt ratings are a2 and p2 by the respective rating agencies. our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes due july 31, 2032, or the 2032 notes, and $2.5 billion credit agreement, or the credit agreement, do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. however, the interest rates and fees on our credit agreement would increase if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded. also, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. our 2032 notes would become convertible into shares of our common stock if the credit ratings assigned to the 2032 notes are downgraded to bbb or lower by s&amp;p or baa3 or lower by moody's. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. our goodwill may become impaired, which could adversely effect our results of operations and financial position. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise; although, our businesses could be in the future. however, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. in the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of interest rate changes. we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. for foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used as an economic hedge to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. for interest rate exposure, derivatives have been used to manage the related cost of debt. as a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 28 we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk, or var, analysis. var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value on our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2013 was not material. because we use foreign currency instruments as an economic hedge, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. foreign exchange risk our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to u.s. dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in

with these transactions, we use forward foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2013 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $207.0 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities. also, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts. at december 31, 2013 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $56.2 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities. by using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. interest rate risk from time to time, we have issued debt in the capital markets. in prior years we have used interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest cost. at december 31, 2013 , there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. on july 31, 2014 , our 2032 notes may be put back to us for cash and we have the right to redeem the notes at any time on or after july 31, 2014 . if the 2032 notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. the extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that is refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. credit risk we provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and in the normal course of business, we grant credit to qualified clients. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 2.7% of revenue in 2013 and no other client accounted for more than 2.5% of revenue. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. 29 in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. in addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies' contracts with media and production providers specify that our

where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.risk factors 3 risk factors adverse global economic conditions could cause clients to reduce spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications services and may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. adverse global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. in particular, a contraction in global economic conditions poses a risk that our clients may reduce future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications services which could reduce the demand for our services. if domestic or global economic conditions deteriorate, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we will continue to monitor economic conditions closely, client revenue levels and other factors, and may take actions available to us to align our cost structure and manage working capital in response to reductions in client revenue. there can be no assurance whether, or to what extent, our efforts to mitigate any impact of future adverse economic conditions, reductions in our client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments will be effective. a reduction in client spending, a delay in client payments or conditions in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our working capital. global economic uncertainty, turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. such events could also lead clients to seek to change their financial relationship with us, and reduce spending on our services, delay the payment for our services or take additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. in response, we could need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements in such circumstances. such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. in an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable. in the normal course of our business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our

available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn. 3 clients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services requirements and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. the markets we operate in are highly competitive and are expected to remain so. key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, the retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, including highly skilled technically proficient personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in 2014 , approximately 50% of our revenue came from our 100 largest clients. clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison to historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. we rely extensively on information technology systems and cyber incidents could adversely affect us. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising information. our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer or process data. while we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in systems of third parties we use, that could adversely affect our reputation or business. government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs. such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. any limitation or judicial action that effects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 4 further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. we face a number of risks associated with a global service business. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business and the risks associated with extensive international operations. we also must comply with applicable u.s. and international anti-corruption laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. for financial information by geographic region, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries and high-growth markets. we conduct business in numerous developing countries and high-growth markets around the world. our operations outside the united states are exposed to risks that include: slower receipt of payments; social, political and economic instability, currency fluctuation and currency repatriation restrictions. in addition, commercial laws in developing countries and high-growth markets can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced or frequently changed. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in countries and markets where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries and markets could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor's rating service, or s&amp;p, rates our long-term debt bbb+ and moody's investors service, or moody's, rates our long-term debt baa1 . our short-term debt ratings are a2 and p2 by the respective rating agencies. our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. our goodwill may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 5 we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise; although, our businesses could be in the future. however, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our business, results of operations and financial position. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. our regional treasury centers use derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, as an economic hedge to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. we use derivative financial instruments, such as fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, to manage the cost of debt more efficiently. as a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk, or var, analysis. var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2014 was not significant. foreign exchange risk our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to u.s. dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. for the most part, revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency, which minimizes the economic impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations. while our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china and japan, our agencies conduct business in more than 50 different currencies. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pool arrangements to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. in certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with a treasury center operating in a different currency. to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we use forward foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2014 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $113.1 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany borrowing and investment activities. also, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts. at december 31, 2014 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $44.0 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these activities. we designate foreign currency derivative instruments as an economic hedge; therefore, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. by using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. 28 interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk has been limited because our senior notes are fixed rate debt. in 2014, to manage our annual interest cost more efficiently by benefiting from a decline in interest rates, we used fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert specific fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. in 2014, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps on the $1.25 billion principal amount of the 2022 notes and the $1 billion principal amount of the 2020 notes. under the swap agreements, we receive fixed interest rate payments equal to the coupon interest rate on the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes and we pay a variable interest rate on the total principal amount of the notes, equal to three month libor in arrears, plus a spread of 1.05% on the 2022 notes and a spread of 2.16% on the 2020 notes. the swaps have the economic effect of converting the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt and effectively convert our long-term debt portfolio to 50% fixed rate debt and 50% floating rate debt. at december 31, 2014 , we recorded a receivable, which is included in other assets, of $42.7 million representing the fair value of the swaps that was substantially offset by the increase in the carrying value of the 2022 notes and the 2020 notes reflecting the change in fair value of the notes. credit risk we provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 2.6% of revenue in 2014 and no other client accounted for more than 2.5% of revenue. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in the normal course of our business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. in addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies' contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services. where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, methods of managing the risk of payment defaults, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.risk factors 3 risk factors adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets, or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. adverse economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. in particular, a global or regional economic downturn poses a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. adverse economic conditions, including a contraction in the availability of credit, may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and such events could cause our clients to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. in such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions and reductions in revenue by aligning our cost structure and managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective. in an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable. in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a

for the media or production services. where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn. clients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. we operate in a highly competitive industry. key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 3 the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in 2015 , approximately 52% of our revenue came from our 100 largest clients. clients generally are able to reduce or cancel their current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business, results of operations and financial position. our international operations represent approximately 44% of our revenue. we operate in all major international markets including the european union, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china and japan. our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly, their financial statements are translated into u.s. dollars. as a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates would impact our business, results of operations and financial position. we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process, store and transmit data, including personally identifiable information, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client advertising and marketing information. our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. additionally, we use third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transmit or process data. there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems, or in the systems of third parties we use, and such events could adversely affect our reputation or business. government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs. such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. any limitation or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 4 further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. we face a number of risks associated with a global business. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and talented staff, currency fluctuation, political conditions, regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations. in addition, we conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed. the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. additionally, we are subject to u.s. and international anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, in all jurisdictions where we operate. these laws are complex and stringent and any violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. for financial information by geographic region, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be

at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our business, results of operations and financial position. 5 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments. we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. additionally, we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. utilizing derivative instruments exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. 26 we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our

significant. foreign exchange risk our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to u.s. dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. for the most part, revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency, which minimizes the economic impact on our operating margin. the effects of currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. our international operations represent approximately 44% of our revenue. while our major international markets include the european union, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china and japan, our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. as an integral part of our global treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools to manage the foreign exchange risk between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. however, in certain circumstances, subsidiaries borrow or invest with a treasury center operating in a different currency. at december 31, 2015 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $22.1 million to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these activities. additionally, there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward contracts. at december 31, 2015 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $85.9 million to manage the foreign exchange risk of these activities. foreign currency derivative instruments are designated as economic hedges; therefore, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. by using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our long-term debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. based on market conditions, we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. at december 31, 2015 , the total aggregate principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was $4.5 billion and the total notional amount of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps was $1.75 billion . the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our debt portfolio to 61% fixed rate obligations and 39% floating rate obligations. on january 19, 2016, we terminated the remaining $1.0 billion notional amount of the swap on the 2022 notes, reducing the outstanding notional amount of the swaps to $750 million . also, we are exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. to manage this risk, we use forward-starting interest rate swaps to lock in the interest rate on future debt issuances. at december 31, 2015 , the total notional amount of the forward-starting interest rate swaps was $1.0 billion . upon settlement of the swap, any gain or loss on the effective portion of the swap will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the new debt or will be recorded in results of operations if the refinancing is not completed. a complete discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. credit risk we provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as

adversely affected. we operate in a highly competitive industry. key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 3 the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. our 100 largest clients comprised approximately 52% of our revenue in 2016 . clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to acquire new clients and to retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business, results of operations and financial position. our international operations comprised approximately 44% of our revenue in 2016 . we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china and japan. our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly, their financial statements are translated into u.s. dollars. as a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates would impact our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by foreign currency exchange changes. we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process, store and transmit data, summarize results, manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information. increased cybersecurity threats and attacks pose a risk to our systems and networks. security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. we use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. we also may have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. despite our efforts to protect our systems and networks and sensitive and personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats. such events could adversely affect our business and reputation. government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs. such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 4 further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and talented staff, currency fluctuation, political conditions, regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations. in addition, we conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed. the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. additionally, we are subject to u.s. and international anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, in all jurisdictions where we operate. these laws are complex and stringent and any violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. for financial information by geographic region, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized know-how of the acquired workforce. as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current cap and trade laws and other regulatory requirements aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise; although, our businesses could be in the future. however, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs; therefore, at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial position. 5 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk through various strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments. we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. utilizing derivative instruments exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. 26 we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk, or var, analysis. var is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2016 was not significant. foreign exchange risk our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to u.s. dollars of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in their local currency. however, for the most part, because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same currency, the economic impact on operating margin is minimized. the effects of currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. our international operations represent approximately 44% of our revenue. while our major international markets include the euro zone, the united kingdom, australia, brazil, canada, china and japan, our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. as an integral part of our global treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools to manage the foreign exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. however, in certain circumstances, subsidiaries borrowing or investing with a treasury center operating in a different currency creates foreign exchange exposure. at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $99.0 million and $22.1 million , respectively, to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these activities. additionally, there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $94.0 million and $85.9 million , respectively, to manage the foreign exchange risk of these activities. the fair value of the forward foreign contracts at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was a net liability of $1.1 million and $0.1 million , respectively. foreign currency derivative instruments are designated as economic hedges; therefore, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. by using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our long-term debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. based on market conditions, we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. at december 31, 2016 , the total principal amount of our fixed rate senior notes was $4.9 billion and the total amount of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps was $1.25 billion . the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our debt portfolio to approximately 75% fixed rate obligations and 25% floating rate obligations. a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. credit risk we provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients who operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 3.0% of revenue in 2016 . however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. 27 in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. in addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies' contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services. where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.risk factors 3 risk factors adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. in addition, a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. in such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective. in an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable. in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients

and networks. security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. we also may have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. we install new systems or upgrade our existing systems to prevent, detect, address and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and we provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity risks. despite our efforts to protect our systems and networks and sensitive and personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, modification or loss of data, employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats. such events could adversely affect our business and reputation. in addition, we use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. cybersecurity incidents at these providers could adversely affect our business and reputation. 4 government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which

marketing and corporate communications requirements and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. we operate in a highly competitive industry. key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 3 the loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. our 100 largest clients represent approximately 51% of our revenue. clients generally are able to reduce or cancel current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any reason. a significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients' perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our business, results of operations and financial position. our international operations represent approximately 48% of our 2018 revenue. we operate in all major international markets including the euro zone, the united kingdom, or the u.k., australia, brazil, canada, china and japan. our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency and accordingly, their financial statements are translated into u.s. dollars. as a result, both adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, funds transferred to the united states can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process, store and transmit data, summarize results, manage our business and maintain client advertising and marketing information. increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, which are becoming more sophisticated, pose a risk to our systems and networks. security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. we also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. our systems and processes to protect against, detect, prevent, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches, theft, modification or loss of data, employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats. such events could adversely affect our business and reputation. in addition, we use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. our insurance may not protect us against damages resulting from cybersecurity incidents, which could adversely affect our business and reputation. government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients' needs. such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. in addition, there has been a tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability to meet our clients' needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 4 further, laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and a number of international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising mediums. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. as a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally and we are exposed to risks from operating in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. the operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic conditions, competition for new business and staff, currency exchange rate fluctuation, political conditions, regulatory environment and other risks associated with extensive international operations. in addition, we conduct business in numerous high-growth markets and developing countries which tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently changed. the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. additionally, our operations are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are complex and stringent, and any violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. for financial information by geographic region, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. we have substantial operations in the u.k. and the euro zone. in june 2016, voters in the u.k. elected to withdraw from the european union, or e.u. (commonly referred to as brexit ). unless the e.u. agrees to an extension, the u.k. is scheduled to exit the e.u. on march, 29, 2019, and it is possible that the u.k. may exit without an agreement in place. the uncertainties related to brexit have cross-border operational, financial and tax implications, among others, and any economic volatility that may arise in the u.k., the e.u. or elsewhere may adversely affect our business. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, the intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized know-how of the acquired workforce. as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. generally, our businesses are not directly affected by current laws and other regulations aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions or otherwise, although our businesses could be in the future. however, we could be indirectly affected by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. further, if our clients are impacted by such laws or requirements, either directly or indirectly, their spending for advertising and marketing services may decline, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs; therefore, at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial position. 5 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through various strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments. we use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense and structure our long-term debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. using derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. we manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. we evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our derivatives. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a value-at-risk, or var, analysis. var is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95% confidence a maximum one-day change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2018 was not significant. foreign currency exchange risk our international operations represent approximately 48% of our revenue. changes in the value of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar affect our results of operations and financial position. for the most part, because the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same local currency, the economic impact on operating margin is minimized. the effects of foreign currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. while our major international markets include the euro zone, the u.k., australia, brazil, canada, china and japan, our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. as an integral part of our global treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use multicurrency pools, and to a lesser extent forward foreign exchange contracts, to manage the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. at december 31, 2018 , there were no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts and at december 31, 2017 , we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $92.8 million . in addition, there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts. to manage that risk, we had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $86.1 million and $136.3 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was a current liability of $0.1 million and a current asset of $0.9 million , respectively. foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges; therefore, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. by using these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. the terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days. interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our long-term debt portfolio to achieve a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. based on market conditions, we may terminate the swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates or to monetize any gain and lock in a reduction in interest expense. gains or losses on termination will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. at december 31, 2018 , the total notional amount of the outstanding fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps was $1.25 billion . the interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting our long-term debt portfolio to approximately 75% fixed rate obligations and 25% floating rate obligations. a discussion of our interest rate swaps is included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 28 credit risk we provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented 3.0% of revenue in 2018 . however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. in addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies' contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services. where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be less available or unavailable during a severe economic downturn.risk factors 3 risk factors adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. economic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. adverse global or regional economic conditions pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. in addition, a disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients and could cause them to delay payment for our services or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. in such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. even if we take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective. in an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or unavailable. in the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. if permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services

highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer, and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, companies put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could then affect our results of operations and financial condition. government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. government agencies and consumer groups have directly or indirectly from time to time affected or attempted to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising,

results of operations and financial condition in the future. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to effectively manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. in addition, we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel. our employees are our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 3 we receive approximately 46% of our revenue from our 100 largest clients, and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects, our business and our results of operations and financial condition. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations. there are some risks of doing business abroad, including those of political instability and exchange controls, which do not affect domestic-focused firms. for financial information on our operations by geographic area, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in various developing countries around the world. the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices; nationalization; social, political and economic instability; and currency repatriation restrictions, among other risks. in addition, commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed, which could then have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor rating service currently rates our long-term debt a-, moody investors service rates our long-term debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our long-term debt a-. our short-term debt ratings are a2, p2 and f2 by the respective agencies. should our debt credit ratings be downgraded, our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and our existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade. the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility, however, would increase if our long-term debt credit rating is downgraded. additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or long-term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies. holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to $2.0 billion, in whole or in part, at specified dates in the future. if we are required to satisfy a put to repurchase our convertible notes, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the put. we also believe that we will still have ample capacity under our existing credit commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event. however, in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were decreased, we could experience difficulties in funding our business operations and would have to seek additional funding alternatives as described more fully in our md&amp;a. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the review we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 4 goodwill may become impaired. we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( u.s. gaap or gaap ) resulting from our prior acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired. we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in our financial statements, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange: our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the u.s. dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 12 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency. this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income. while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union (emu), the united kingdom, japan, brazil and canada. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest. in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts. at december 31, 2006, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $47.9 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany cash movement. the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to 365 days with an average duration of just over 100 days. in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge u.s. dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center, whose functional currency is the british pound. at december 31, 2006, we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding. additionally, at december 31, 2006 we had cross-currency interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional principal amount of 230.0 million (euro) maturing in 2010 and japanese yen-based cross-currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of japanese yen 22.0 billion maturing in 2013. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of each type of derivative instrument. the forward foreign exchange and swap contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. as a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. in using these contracts, we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk. to minimize counterparty risk, we only enter into these contracts with major well-known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating. 27 these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations. we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value-at-risk computation. value-at-risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments. the value-at-risk analysis we performed on our december 31, 2006 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action, if appropriate. debt instruments: in march 2006, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april 15, 2016. the gross proceeds from the issuance were $995.1 million. the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 6.05% yield to maturity. the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc. and two of our wholly-owned finance subsidiaries, omnicom capital inc. and omnicom finance inc., as co-obligors, similar to our convertible notes. the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co-obligors. in june 2006, we amended and extended our five-year credit facility to june 23, 2011 and increased the amount available from $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion with substantially the same bank consortium. in conjunction with this amendment and extension, we terminated our $400.0 million 364-day revolving credit facility that was due to expire. subsequently, in september 2006, the facility was increased from $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings, if any, under our five-year credit facility as long-term debt. in funding our day-to-day liquidity, we are an active participant in the commercial paper market with a $1.5 billion program. as of december 31, 2006, we had no commercial paper outstanding. our credit facility provides credit support for commercial paper, as well as providing back-up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us. our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank, jp morgan chase, hsbc, abn amro, deutsche, bank of america, societe generale and bbva. we also include large regional banks in the u.s. such as wachovia, us bancorp, northern trust, pnc and wells fargo. we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as sumitomo in japan, fortis in belgium, intesa san paolo in italy, scotia in canada and westpac in australia. our other long-term debt consists principally of convertible notes. as previously discussed, the holders of these convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount. we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date. if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including our stock price, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense could increase. the extent, if any, of the increase in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the instrument. the supplemental interest payments made in 2005 and 2006 to qualified noteholders, as described above under debt instruments, guarantees and related covenants, are one method of keeping the convertible notes outstanding. if we are required to satisfy a put, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put, while still preserving ample capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event. our credit commitments allow either the issuance of commercial paper or bank loans, and we would likely fund the put initially using some combination of these instruments. we would then evaluate all funding alternatives available to us to replenish our credit capacity and liquidity. we believe the funding alternatives would include substantially all forms of debt, equity and convertible instruments available to us by accessing the public or private capital markets. our evaluation would likely include the expected cash flows from the normal course of our business operations and the credit capacity to fund additional potential puts on the remaining outstanding convertible notes. 28 currently, we meet all of our debt covenant requirements. our credit facilities contain financial covenants limiting the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda (for purposes of these covenants ebitda is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to no more than 3.0 times. at december 31, 2006, our ratio of debt to ebitda was 1.8 times. in addition, we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 5.0 times. at december 31, 2006, our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was 13.4 times. we were in compliance with these covenants. in addition, the credit facilities do not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends. even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio. if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this potential increase in interest expense would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as ebitda to interest expense. however, the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by 50%, or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by 50%, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. thus, we do not expect any negative impact on our credit ratings if the convertible notes are put to us.risk factors 3 risk factors companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer, and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, companies put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could then affect our results of operations and financial condition. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to effectively manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. in addition, we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel. our employees are our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. government agencies and consumer groups have directly or indirectly from time to time affected or attempted to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, whether through regulations or other governmental actions. any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, there has been an 3 increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. we cannot assure investors that such claims by businesses or governmental agencies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future. we receive approximately 46% of our revenue from our 100

an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we may be impacted during periods of economic recession. our business may be adversely affected by downturns in general economic conditions or during periods of economic recession due to potential reductions in client advertising, marketing and corporate communications budgets and overall spending levels. the effect of a reduction in any of these items could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations. there are some risks of doing business abroad, including those of political instability and exchange controls, which do not affect domestic-focused firms. for financial information on our operations by geographic area, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in various developing countries around the world. the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices; nationalization; social, political and economic instability; and currency repatriation restrictions, among other risks. in addition, commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed, which

however, in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were decreased, we could experience difficulties in funding our business operations and would have to seek additional funding alternatives as described more fully in our md&amp;a. furthermore, the 2031, 2032, 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible, at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2031 notes and the 2032 notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard &amp; poor ratings service, or baa3 or lower by moody investors service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 notes to bbb- or lower by s&amp;p, and ba1 or lower by moody s. these events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder right to cause us to repurchase the notes. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor rating service currently rates our long-term debt a-, moody investors service rates our long-term debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our long-term debt a-. our short-term debt ratings are a2, p2 and f2 by the respective agencies. our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and our existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade. the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility,

ratio requirements. thus, we do not expect any negative impact on our credit ratings if the convertible notes are put to us. credit markets: during the third quarter of 2007, volatility in the financial markets resulted in an increase in borrowing spreads in the commercial paper market. to mitigate the effect of these increased spreads, we arranged for $300.0 million in unsecured uncommitted lines of credit and shifted the funding of a portion of our daily borrowing needs to these lines from our commercial paper program. at december 31, 2007 there were no borrowings outstanding under these unsecured uncommitted lines of credit, as these lines were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2007. at december 31, 2007, the volatility in the credit markets did not have any impact on our debt instruments and credit ratings.risk factors 3 risk factors the global economic recession could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial condition. contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit, a decrease in consumer and business spending, a significant rise in unemployment and other factors have all contributed to a global economic recession. to some extent, every industry sector in most markets around the world has been adversely affected by the current economic conditions. this has led to discretionary reductions in advertising, marketing and corporate communications services spending by both our u.s. and international clients and was a contributing factor to the year-over-year decrease in our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008. we expect that clients marketing spending will continue to contract for the near term. if the global economic recession continues, our clients businesses could be adversely affected which would likely lead to reductions in client spending. these reductions could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition. the global credit crisis could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. the bursting of the housing bubble and the related mortgage defaults that followed ultimately led to a crisis in the credit markets and a contraction in the availability of credit. this crisis has made it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements. a continuation of the credit crisis coupled with a prolonged economic recession could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. if that were to occur, we could require additional capital to fund the changes in our day-to-day working capital requirements. there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, in connection with the global credit crisis, several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our 2.5 billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments. in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity, the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment. as a result, the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could require additional capital. there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. in a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase. in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue. these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, 3 in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. further, in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. this risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital. working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year. this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients, including when we place media and incur production costs. we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations. the global economic recession could cause a reduction in the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which would negatively affect our working capital. consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer, and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we received approximately 47% of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2008, and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects, business and results of operations and financial condition. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. in addition, we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel. our employees are our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 4 government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulations or other governmental actions. any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations. there are risks of doing business abroad, including those of political instability and exchange controls, which do not affect domestic-focused firms. these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. for financial information on our operations by geographic area, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices, nationalization, social, political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions, among other risks. in addition, commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to 1.2 billion, in whole or in part, at specified dates in the future. in july 2009, 727 million of our 2032 notes can be put back to us for repurchase. in june 2010, our 2033 and 2038 notes aggregating 467.5 million can be put to us for repurchase. (see next paragraph regarding our 2031 notes) if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts. we also believe that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event. however, in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we might need to seek additional funding alternatives. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. on february 9, 2009, holders of 841.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes had put their notes to us for purchase at par. we borrowed 814.4 million under our credit facility and received 26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes. we purchased and retired 295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put. the partnership, formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes, used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 546.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put. the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor rating service currently rates our long-term debt a-, moody investors service rates our long-term debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our long-term debt a-. our short-term debt ratings are a2, p2 and f2 by the respective agencies. our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade. the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility, however, would increase if our long-term debt credit rating is downgraded. 5 additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short- or long-term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies. furthermore, the 2031, 2032, 2033 and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2031 notes and the 2032 notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard &amp; poor ratings service, or baa3 or lower by moody investors service or in the case of the 2033 and 2038 notes to bbb- or lower by s&amp;p, and ba1 or lower by moody s. these events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder right to cause us to repurchase the notes. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the review we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. goodwill may become impaired. in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( us gaap or gaap ), we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired. we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange: our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the u.s. dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 13 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency. this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income. while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union (emu), the united kingdom, japan, brazil and canada. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest. in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts. at december 31, 2008, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $588.2 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments. the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to 365 days with an average duration under 90 days. in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge u.s. dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center, whose functional currency is the british pound. at december 31, 2008, we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding. additionally, during the second half of 2008, we terminated our euro and yen denominated cross-currency interest rate swaps. the effect of terminating our euro and yen denominated swaps on our results of operations was not significant. the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. as a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. in using these contracts, we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk. to minimize counterparty risk, we only enter into these contracts with major well-known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating. these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations. we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency 29 exchange rates and other relevant market risks. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value-at-risk computation. value-at-risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments. the value-at-risk analysis we performed on our december 31, 2008 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action, if appropriate. debt instruments: in march 2006, we issued 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april 15, 2016. the gross proceeds from the issuance were 995.1 million. the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 6.05% yield to maturity. the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc. and two of our wholly-owned finance subsidiaries, omnicom capital inc. and omnicom finance inc., as co-obligors. the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co-obligors. we maintain a 2.5 billion credit facility that expires on june 23, 2011. we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings, if any, under our credit facility as long-term debt. our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank, jpmorgan chase, hsbc, rbs, deutsche, bank of america, societe generale and bbva. we also include large regional banks in the u.s. such as us bancorp, northern trust, pnc and wells fargo. we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as bnp paribas in france, sumitomo in japan, intesa san paolo in italy, scotia in canada and anz in australia. recently, several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions. wachovia, comprising a 100 million commitment, merged with wells fargo. wells fargo is a member of our bank syndicate. in addition, abn amro, comprising a 150 million commitment, merged with rbs. rbs was not a member of our bank syndicate prior to the merger with abn amro. additionally, in connection with the global credit crisis, several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central governments. in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity, the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us. the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount. at december 31, 2008, the next dates on which holders of the 2031 notes and 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash are february 2009 and july 2009, respectively. the next date on which holders of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010. as we have done on prior occasions, we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date. if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including our stock price, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. on february 9, 2009, holders of 841.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 notes put their notes to us for purchase at par. we borrowed 814.4 million under our credit facility and received 26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in a partnership we control to fund the purchase of the 2031 notes. we purchased and retired 295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that had been put. the partnership, formed for the purpose of buying the 2031 notes, used a portion of our credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining 546.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 notes that were put. the partnership purchased the 2031 notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit. if the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put. although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event. additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our 30 interest expense will change. the extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio. if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as ebitda to interest expense. however, the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by 50%, or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by 50%, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. concentration of credit risk: we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and, in the normal course of business, we grant credit to qualified clients. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 2.8%, and no other client accounted for more than 2.1% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31, 2008. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in many of our businesses, we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue. these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. further, in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients. however, this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn.risk factors 3 risk factors global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position. contraction in the global economy led to reductions in advertising, marketing and corporate communications services spending by both our u.s. and international clients and was a significant factor to the year-over-year decrease in our revenue in 2009. the decline was broad-based across most industries and geographic areas. despite recent economic improvement, a future economic downturn and a further reduction in consumer spending could result in further reduction in client spending levels that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial position. renewed turmoil in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. renewed turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit similar to the conditions experienced beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009 would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. if that were to occur, we could require additional capital to fund the changes in our day-today working capital requirements. there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. additionally, during the recent credit crisis, several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our $2.5 billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments. in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity, the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment. as a result, the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could require additional capital. further, our $2.5 billion credit facility expires in june 2011. we expect to replace this facility with similar financing. there is no assurance that such financing will be available on comparable terms, if at all. this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. in a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase. in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide. these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and, in many 3 cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. further, in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. this risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital. working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year. this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients, including when we place media and incur production costs. we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations. the global economic recession has caused and could continue to cause a reduction of the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which could negatively affect our working capital. consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. the markets in which we participate are highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer, and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost accounts in

business, results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected. in addition, we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel. our employees are our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we received approximately 50.4% of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2009, and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects, business and results of operations and financial position. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 4 government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. any such limitation on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future. government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. these actions would cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations. there are risks of doing business abroad, including those of political instability and foreign exchange controls, which do not affect domestic-focused firms. these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position. for financial information on our operations by geographic area, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices, nationalization, social, political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions, among other risks. in addition, commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects, business, financial position and results of operations in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to $726 million, in whole or in part, at specified dates in the future. in june 2010, our 2033 notes and 2038 notes aggregating $467.5 million may be put back to us for repurchase and in july 2010, $252.7 million of our 2032 notes may be put back to us for repurchase. if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts. we also believe that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event. however, in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we might need to seek additional funding alternatives. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms, if

facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade. the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility, however, would increase if our long-term debt credit rating is downgraded. additionally, our access 5 to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short- or long-term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies. furthermore, the 2032 notes, 2033 notes and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2032 notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard &amp; poor ratings service, or baa3 or lower by moody investors service or in the case of the 2033 notes and 2038 notes to bbb- or lower by s&amp;p, and ba1 or

which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired. we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting non-cash impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. although our companies may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and current requirements to reduce emissions, we could be in the future. however, we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange: our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the u.s. dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency. this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations. while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union (emu), the united kingdom, japan, brazil and canada. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest. in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts. at december 31, 2009, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $900.7 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments. the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from 5 to 455 days with an average duration under 90 days. in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement, we enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge u.s. dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center, whose functional currency is the british pound. at december 31, 2009, we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as we had no commercial paper outstanding. the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. as a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. in using these contracts, we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk. to minimize counterparty risk, we only enter into these contracts with major well-known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating. these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations. we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value-at-risk computation. value-at-risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments. the value-at-risk analysis we performed on our december 31, 2009 portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action, if appropriate. interest rate risk: substantially all of our long-term debt is fixed rate debt and is not affected by changes in interest rates. in managing our day-to-day liquidity, we may issue commercial paper, borrow under our $2.5 billion credit facility or borrow under our uncommitted lines of credit. interest on this debt is variable. interest expense on our variable rate debt was approximately $13 million out of our total interest expense of $122.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2009. our $2.5 billion credit facility expires on june 23, 2011. our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank, jpmorgan chase, hsbc, rbs, deutsche, bank of america, societe generale and bbva. we also include large regional banks in the u.s. such as us bancorp, northern trust, pnc and wells fargo. we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as bnp paribas in france, sumitomo in japan, intesa san paolo in italy, scotia in canada and anz in australia. several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions. additionally, during the recent credit crisis, several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central 32 governments. in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity, the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us. the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount. the next date on which holders of our 2033 notes and 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2010 and the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is july 2010. as we have done on prior occasions, we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date. if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including our stock price, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. if the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put. although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event. additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. the extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio. if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as ebitda to interest expense. however, the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to double or our ratio of ebitda was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. credit risk: we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 3.1% of our revenue, and no other client accounted for more than 2.5% of our revenue for 2009. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in many of our businesses, we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide. these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. further, in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients. however, this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn. 33risk factors 3 risk factors future global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position. in 2010, our revenue increased 7.0% compared to 2009. the increase reflects an improvement in business conditions in our industry over 2009. however, the pace of the global economic recovery is uneven and a future economic downturn could renew reductions in client spending levels and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, client spending and other factors, and will take actions available to us to improve our cost structure and manage working capital. in the current environment there can be no assurance of the effects of future economic conditions, client spending patterns, client creditworthiness and other developments on us and whether or to what extent our efforts to respond will be effective. conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. if that were to occur, we may require additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. in a period of severe economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of our clients could significantly increase. in the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services provided. many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. the media commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. in addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance. however, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client. the risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could have a material adverse effect on our working capital. the recent global recession caused a reduction in the volume of client spending and/or a delay in the time our clients took to pay us, negatively affecting our working capital. renewed global economic uncertainty could cause our clients to take the same or additional actions that would negatively affect our working capital. consequently, we could need to obtain additional financing in such circumstances. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms, if at all. such circumstances could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 3 companies periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships. if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected. the markets in which we participate are highly competitive. key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs, the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer and our ability to efficiently serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis. while many of our client relationships are long-standing, from time to time clients put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review. we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews. to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships, retention of key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients perceptions of, or policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships. if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected. our employees are our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. further, as the evolution of our business continues to become integrated with the digital marketplace, we are increasingly dependent on the technical skills of a highly skilled workforce and their ability to maintain the skills necessary to serve our clients. we received approximately 50.6% of our revenue from our 100 largest clients in 2010, and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason. it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns, or they could reduce future spending. a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client marketing and advertising strategies. the size and complexity of our technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our reputation or business. government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services, which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental action. any limitation on the scope of 4 the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices. such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future. government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. these actions could cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. laws and regulations, related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the united states and certain international markets. these laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of the internet as an advertising medium. these actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we face a number of risks normally associated with global services businesses. the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions, competition for client assignments and talented staff, new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations. the risks of doing business abroad, including political instability and foreign exchange controls, do not affect domestic-focused firms. these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position. for financial information on our operations by geographic area, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries. we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world. some of the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries include: slower payment of invoices; nationalization; social, political and economic instability; and currency repatriation restrictions. in addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business, our prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to $660 million of notes, in whole or in part, at specified dates in the future. in august 2011, $252.7 million of our convertible notes due july 31, 2032 ( 2032 notes ) may be put back to us for repurchase and in june 2013, $406.7 million of our convertible notes due july 1, 2038 ( 2038 notes ) may be put back to us for repurchase. if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts. we also believe that we will have sufficient capacity under our credit facility to meet our cash requirements for our normal business operations after any put. however, in the event that our credit facility or our cash flow from operations were to decrease, we may need to seek additional funding. there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms, if at all. downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us. standard and poor rating service currently rates our long-term debt bbb+, moody investors service rates our long-term debt baa1 and fitch ratings rates our long-term debt a-. our short-term debt ratings are a2, p2 and f2 by the respective agencies. our outstanding senior notes, convertible notes and bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a ratings downgrade. the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility, however, would increase if our long-term debt credit rating is downgraded. 5 additionally, our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by downgrades in our short-term or long-term debt credit ratings. furthermore, the 2032 notes and 2038 notes are convertible at specified ratios if, in the case of the 2032 notes, our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard &amp; poor ratings service, or baa3 or lower by moody investors service or in the case of the 2038 notes to bbb- or lower by s&amp;p, and ba1 or lower by moody s. these events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder right to cause us to repurchase the notes. we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. we regularly evaluate potential acquisition of businesses that we believe are complementary to our businesses and client needs. as part of the evaluation, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. as a result, we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition. if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. goodwill may become impaired. in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap or gaap, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the acquired businesses. as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. while we have concluded, for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. any resulting non-cash impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions. although our businesses may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and current requirements to reduce emissions, we could be in the future. however, we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers. additionally, to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations, we may need to incur additional costs. at this time, we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a global service business, we operate in multiple foreign currencies and issue debt in the capital markets. in the normal course of business, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. we limit these risks through risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives. for interest rate exposure, derivatives are used to manage the related cost of debt. for foreign currency exposure, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. as a result of using derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on credit ratings and other factors. we evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks on our derivative instruments. we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivative instruments by performing a value-at-risk analysis. value-at-risk is a statistical model that utilizes historical currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our derivative financial instruments. the value-at-risk analysis on our derivative financial instruments at december 31, 2010 indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial. foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the u.s. dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations, which are generally denominated in the local currency. the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note 20 of our consolidated financial statements. for the most part, our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency. this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations. while our agencies conduct business in more than 70 different currencies, our major non-u.s. currency markets are the european monetary union (emu), the united kingdom, japan, brazil and canada. as an integral part of our treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use a multicurrency pool arrangement to manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of the treasury centers from which they borrow or invest funds. in certain circumstances, instead of using a multicurrency pool, operations can borrow or invest on an intercompany basis with an intercompany treasury center operating in a different currency. to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with these transactions, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with third party banks. at december 31, 2010, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $1,300.0 million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of these intercompany borrowings and investments. furthermore, we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with activities when operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency. in these instances, amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts. at december 31, 2010, we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of $51.8 million related to these activities. the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks. these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program. as a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. interest rate risk from time to time, we issue debt in the capital markets. in 2010, to manage our overall interest cost, we used interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt and designated the swaps as a fair value hedge. see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps. at december 31, 2010, the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was $1.0 billion. the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount outstanding. the next date on which holders of our 2032 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is august 2011 and the next date on which holders of our 2038 notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june 2013. as we have done on prior occasions, we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us. 30 if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment, the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date, including our stock price, short-term interest rates and a factor for credit risk. if our outstanding convertible notes are put back to us, based on our current financial condition and expectations, we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put. although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements, we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put. additionally, if the convertible notes are put back to us, our interest expense will change. the extent, if any, of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced, when we refinance, the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing. even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio. if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest-bearing debt at prevailing rates, this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios, such as ebitda to interest expense. however, the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds. if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to increase 50% or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was to halve, we would still be in compliance with these covenants. therefore, based on our current coverage ratios, our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets, we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements. credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients. due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for 3.0% of our revenue, and no other client accounted for more than 2.4% of our revenue for 2010. however, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. in the normal course of business, we often enter into contractual commitments with media providers and agreements with production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide. many of our agencies purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal. these commitments are included in accounts payable when the media services are delivered by the media providers. while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligation then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client. in other countries, we manage our risk in other ways, including evaluating and monitoring our clients creditworthiness and, in many cases, requiring credit insurance or payment in advance. further, in cases where we are committed to a media purchase and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media, options are potentially available to us in the marketplace, in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss, including negotiating with media providers. in addition, our agencies incur production costs on behalf of clients. we usually act as an agent for a disclosed principal in the procurement of these services. we manage the risk of payment default by the client by having the production companies be subject to sequential liability or requiring at least partial payment in advance. however, the agreements entered into, as well as the production costs incurred are unique to each client. we have not experienced a material loss related to media purchases or on production costs incurred on behalf of our clients. however, the risk of a material loss could increase in a significant economic downturn.
