quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. after considering the effects of interest rate swaps, further described below, the company's variable rate debt represents 66% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2002 and 1% in 2001. management 20 has entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that partially mitigate the impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. at december 31, 2002, an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the company's annual earnings by $882,000, assuming no additional intervention strategies by management. the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 133, and as amended by sfas 138, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities" effective january 1, 2001. in the application, the company has concluded that its swap contracts qualify for "special cash flow hedge accounting" which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet (see note 22 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report). this fluctuation is not expected to have a material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. foreign currency exchange risk the company occasionally enters into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which the company has significant operations. as of december 31, 2002, the company had no such instruments outstanding. wabtec is also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent its operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2002, approximately 76% of wabtec's net sales are in the united states, 7% in canada, 2% in mexico, and 15% in other international locations, primarily europe. (see note 21 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report). at december 31, 2002, the company does not believe changes in foreign currency exchange rates represent a material risk to results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. wabtec's market risk exposure is not substantially different from its exposure at december 31, 2001. recent accounting pronouncements see notes 2 and 8 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 25 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. after considering the effects of interest rate swaps, further described below, our variable rate debt represents 0% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2003 and 66% in 2002. management has entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigates the impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. at december 31, 2003, an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not reduce our annual earnings. we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards ( sfas ) no. 133, and as amended by sfas 138, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january 1, 2001. in the application, we have concluded that our swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet (see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). this fluctuation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. foreign currency exchange risk we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2003, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2004. we entered into foreign currency options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. a currency option gives us the right but not the obligation to exchange currency at a pre-determined exchange rate either on a specific date or within a specific period of time. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. all outstanding forward contracts and option agreements are for the sale of u.s. dollars (usd) and the purchase of canadian dollars (cad). as of december 31, 2003, we had outstanding option agreements with a notional value of $10.5 million cad resulting in the recording of a current asset of $270,000 and an increase in comprehensive income of $171,000, net of tax and has forward contracts with a notional value of $13.5 million cad, resulting in the 25 table of contents recording of a current asset of $100,000 and an increase in comprehensive income of $64,000, net of tax. subsequent to december 31, 2003, the company entered into additional forward contracts to hedge its exposure to canadian currency risk. including the forwards outstanding at the end of 2003, the forward contracts currently have a total notional value of $83 million cad (or $62 million usd), with an average exchange rate of $0.747 usd per $1 cad. we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2003, approximately 69% of wabtec net sales are in the united states, 9% in canada, 1% in mexico, and 21% in other international locations, primarily europe. (see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2002. recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt. there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2004. after considering the effects of interest rate swaps, further described below, our variable rate debt represented 0% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2003. management had entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004. in 2003, we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for special cash flow hedge accounting which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet (see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). foreign currency exchange risk we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2004, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2005. we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of u.s. dollars (usd) and the purchase of canadian dollars (cad). as of december 31, 2004, we had forward contracts with a notional value of $59 million cad (or $43.5 million u.s.), with an average exchange rate of $0.74 usd per $1 cad, resulting in the recording of a current asset and an increase in comprehensive income of $3.6 million, net of tax. we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2004, approximately 66% of wabtec net sales are in the united states, 10% in canada, 2% in mexico, and 22% in other international locations, primarily europe. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2003. 29 recent accounting pronouncements effective december 31, 2003, wabtec adopted sfas no. 132 (revised 2003), employers disclosures about pensions and other post-retirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88 and 106 for its u.s. pension plans. this standard requires additional disclosures about an employer pension plans and postretirement benefits such as: the type of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations, cash flows, and components of net periodic benefit costs recognized during interim periods. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for the required additional disclosures. in november 2004, the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued sfas no. 151, (inventory costs an amendment of arb no. 43, chapter 4. this standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges. additionally, this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. the provisions of this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2005. the company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on the company financial statements and results of operations. sfas no. 123 (revised 2004) share-based payment was issued in december 2004. this standard requires companies to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value. the effective date is the first interim reporting period beginning after june 15, 2005. wabtec is currently evaluating pricing models and the transition provisions of this standard and will begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005. in december 2004, the fasb issued fsp no. 109-2, accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004. fsp 109-2 provides guidance under sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 (the jobs act ) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. the jobs act was enacted on october 22, 2004. fsp 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the impact of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no. 109. the company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. accordingly, provided for in fsp 109-2, the company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the job act.risk factors 10 risk factors. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2005, our top five customers, electro-motive diesel, general electric transportation systems, burlington northern santa fe, bombardier and national steel car, accounted for 24% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and, as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than us. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a limited number of cost conscious purchasers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. 10 table of contents we intend to pursue future acquisition strategies that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combinations that we believe will improve our market position and realize operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings. acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combinations involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate synergistic and strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the level of use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales has been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. 11 table of contents prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally (including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries) could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2005, 24% of our consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside of north america and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, canada, china, france, india, italy, mexico and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. actions have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. since 2000, the number of such claims has increased. most of these claims have been made against our wholly-owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc before we acquired american standard, inc. (asi) 50% interest in rfpc in 1990. we acquired the remaining interest in rfpc in 1992. these claims include a suit against rfpc and its insurers seeking coverage under rfpc insurance policies. on april 17, 2005, the claim against the company contending that the company assumed asi liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc products was resolved in the company favor. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. 12 table of contents we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. our manufacturer warranties may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure you that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 41% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through late 2006, 2007 and 2009. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure you that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2005, we have total debt of $150 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. 13 table of contents the indenture for our $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes due 2013 and our refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt. there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2005 and 2004. management had entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004. in 2003, we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for special cash flow hedge accounting which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. foreign currency exchange risk we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2005, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2006. we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of u.s. dollars (usd) and the purchase of canadian dollars (cad). as of december 31, 2005, we had forward contracts with a notional value of $24 million cad (or $19.3 million u.s.), with an average exchange rate of $0.80 usd per $1 cad, resulting in the recording of a current asset and an increase in comprehensive income of $877,000, net of tax. 36 table of contents we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2005, approximately 64% of wabtec net sales are in the united states, 11% in canada, 1% in mexico, and 24% in other international locations, primarily europe. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2004. recent accounting pronouncements in november 2004, the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued statement of financial accounting standard ( sfas ) no. 151, inventory costs an amendment of arb no. 43, chapter 4. this standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges. additionally, this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. the provisions of this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2005. the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 151 to have a material impact on the company financial position or results of operations. in december 2004, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no. 123 (revised 2004) share-based payment. this statement replaces fasb statement no. 123 and supersedes apb opinion no. 25. no. 123(r) eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the company. fasb no. 123(r) requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method that would result in expense being recognized in the company financial statements. the company will be required to adopt no. 123(r) in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of an extension granted by the securities and exchange commission on april 14, 2005. the adoption of no. 123(r) is expected to reduce quarterly earnings by approximately $0.01 per share in 2006. in december 2004, the fasb issued staff position ( fsp ) no. 109-2, accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004. fsp 109-2 provides guidance under sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 (the jobs act ) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. the jobs act was enacted on october 22, 2004. fsp 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the impact of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no. 109. the company evaluated the impact of the repatriation provisions and has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act. in march 2005, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. 47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations. this statement requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. the provisions of this statement are effective for years ending after december 15, 2005. the company does not expect the adoption of fasb 47 to have a material impact on the company financial position or results of operations. in june 2005, the fasb issued sfas no. 154, accounting changes and error corrections, a replacement of apb opinion no. 20 and fasb statement no. 3. sfas no. 154 requires retrospective application to financial statements of prior periods for changes in accounting principle that are not adopted prospectively. this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005. the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 154 to have a material impact on the company financial position or results of operations.risk factors 10 risk factors. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on

adversely affected. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2006, 22% of our consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside of north america and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, canada, china, france, germany, india, italy, mexico and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. since 2000, the number of such claims has increased and the resolution of these claims may take a significant period of 12 table of contents time. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. on april 17, 2005, a claim against the company by a former stockholder of rfpc contending that the company assumed that entity liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc product was resolved in the company favor. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. it is management belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present for a variety of factors, including: (1) the limited asbestos case settlement history of the company wholly owned subsidiary, rfpc; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the company operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, management believes that the final resolution of the company asbestos-related cases will not be material to the company overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in general, this belief is based upon: (1) wabtec and rfpc limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss. more specifically, as to rfpc, management belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. to date, rfpc insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions. as to wabtec and its divisions, management belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of wabtec assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. to date, wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed wabtec position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets. although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently 13 table of contents maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure you that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 41% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2007, 2008, and 2009. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure you that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2006, we have total debt of $150 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes due 2013 and our refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. 14 table of contents the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock of schaefer and becorit for a combined $87.2 million, net of cash received. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt. there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2006 and 2005. management had entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variable-rate debt interest rate increases. these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004. in 2003, we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for special cash flow hedge accounting which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. foreign currency exchange risk we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2006, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2007. we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of u.s. dollars (usd) and the purchase of canadian dollars (cad). as of december 31, 2006, we had forward contracts with a notional value of $48 million cad (or $42.7 million u.s.), with an average exchange rate of $0.89 usd per $1 cad, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $1.3 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $825,000, net of tax. we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2006, approximately 66% of wabtec net sales are in the united states, 10% in canada, 2% in mexico, 4% in australia, 1% in germany, 9% in the united kingdom, and 8% in other international locations. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2005. recent accounting pronouncements in july 2006, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued fasb interpretation no. 48 (fin 48), accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. fin 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007. the cumulative effects, if any, of applying this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88, 106 and 132(r), (sfas 158). sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. this company has adopted the provisions of sfas 158 as of december 31, 2006. the provisions of sfas 158 are to be applied on a prospective basis; therefore, prior 38 table of contents periods presented have not been restated. the adoption in 2006 had no effect on the computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and postretirement benefits. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for the impact of the adoption on the company consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2006. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements (sfas 157). sfas 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. sfas 157 becomes effective for wabtec on january 1, 2008. upon adoption, the provisions of sfas 157 are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. the adoption of sfas 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements. effective january 1, 2006, wabtec adopted sfas 123 (r), which requires the company to recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. this expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant. wabtec has elected the modified prospective transition method for adoption, and prior periods financial statements have not been restated. prior to january 1, 2006, wabtec accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no. 25 (apb 25), accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations. as a result of the adoption, stock-based compensation expense for 2006 includes $1.3 million of expense related to stock options that previously was not recognized under apb 25.risk factors 9 risk factors. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2007, our top five customers, electro-motive diesel, greater toronto transit authority (go transit), ge transportation systems, trinity industries, and alstom, accounted for 23% of our net sales in 2007. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. 9 table of contents the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales has been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally (including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries) could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2007, about 40% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, canada, china, france, germany, india, italy, mexico, spain, south africa, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. since 2000, the number of such claims has increased and the resolution of these claims may take a significant period of time. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. on april 17, 2005, a claim against the company by a former stockholder of rfpc contending that the company assumed that entity liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc product was resolved in the company favor. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. 10 table of contents it is management belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the limited asbestos case settlement history of the company wholly owned subsidiary, rfpc; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the company operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, management believes that the final resolution of the company asbestos-related cases will not be material to the company overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in general, this belief is based upon: (1) wabtec and rfpc limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss. more specifically, as to rfpc, management belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. to date, rfpc insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions. as to wabtec and its divisions, management belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of wabtec assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. to date, wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed wabtec position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets. although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 37% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2008, 2009, and 2010. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. 11 table of contents our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2007, we have total debt of $150.3 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes due in 2013 and our refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2006 and 2007, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock of schaefer, becorit, and ricon for a combined $161.6 million, net of cash received. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt. there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2007 and 2006. foreign currency exchange risk we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2007, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2008 the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. at december 31, 2006, the company had forward contracts for the sale of u.s. dollars (usd) and the purchase of canadian dollars (cad). the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2006, the company had forward contracts with a notional value of $48 million cad (or $42.7 million u.s.) with an average exchange rate of $0.89 usd per $1 cad, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $1.3 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $825,000, net of tax. during 2007, these foreign currency forward contracts were settled. at december 31, 2007, the company had forward contracts for the sale of usd and the purchase of euro with a notional value of 2.3 million euro (or $3.1 million usd), with an average exchange rate of $1.32 usd per 1 euro. these forward contracts are used to mitigate the variability in cash flows from the payment of liabilities denominated in currencies other than the usd. since the company does not treat these derivatives as hedges, the change in fair value of both the forward contracts and the related liabilities are recorded in the income statement. in 2007, the company recorded a fair value gain in the amount of $315,000. 30 table of contents we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2007, approximately 60% of wabtec net sales were to the united states, 12% to canada, 3% to mexico, 3% to australia, 2% to germany, 11% to the united kingdom, and 9% in other international locations. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2006. recent accounting pronouncements in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements, (sfas 157). sfas 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. sfas 157 became effective for wabtec on january 1, 2008. upon adoption, the provisions of sfas 157 are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement. the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no. 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes ( fin 48 ) an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109 on january 1, 2007. the implementation of fin 48 has resulted in a $2.7 million reduction to the beginning balance of retained earnings, reported as a change in accounting principle. at the adoption date of january 1, 2007, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $13.5 million, of which $8.0 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company effective tax rate. as of december 31, 2007, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $17.2 million, of which $10.6 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company effective income tax rate. the $3.7 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits during the year ended december 31, 2007 primarily relates to the filing of amended returns. the company includes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. at january 1, 2007, the company accrued interest and penalties of approximately $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. due to the increase in unrecognized tax benefits identified above, the company has accrued additional interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions during the year ended december 31, 2007. the total interest and penalties accrued as of december 31, 2007 are approximately $3.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2006, the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88, 106 and 132(r) (sfas 158). the company must adopt the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 by december 31, 2008. in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no. 115. sfas no. 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. sfas no. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement. in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141 (revised), business combinations ( sfas no. 141 (r) ), replacing sfas no. 141, business combinations ( sfas no. 141 ), and sfas no. 160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no. 51 ( sfas no. 160 ). sfas no. 141(r) retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no. 141, broadens its scope by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, and requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, that liabilities related to contingent consideration be recognized at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period, that acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that income be recognized if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred. sfas no. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests (i.e., minority interests) in a subsidiary, including changes in a parent ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires, among other things, that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be classified as a separate component of equity. except for the presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas no. 160, which are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented, sfas no. 141 (r) and sfas no. 160 are to be applied prospectively in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2008. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these statements.risk factors 11 risk factors. prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally (including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries) could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2008, our top five customers, greater toronto transit authority (go transit), ge transportation systems, maryland department of transportation, trinity industries, and alstom, accounted for 27% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical 11 table of contents industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. 12 table of contents our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2008, approximately 41% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, canada, china, france, germany, india, italy, kunta hora, macedonia, malaysia, mexico, poland, spain, south africa, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. 13 table of contents we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. over the last four years, the overall number of new claims filed has significantly decreased as compared to the previous four year period; however, the resolution of these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. it is management belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the limited asbestos case settlement history of the company wholly owned subsidiary, rfpc; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the company operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, management believes that the final resolution of the company asbestos-related cases will not be material to the company overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in general, this belief is based upon: (1) wabtec and rfpc limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss. more specifically, as to rfpc, management belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. to date, rfpc insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions. as to wabtec and its divisions, management belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of wabtec assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. to date, wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed wabtec position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets. although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal 14 table of contents injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 32% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. agreements expiring in 2009 cover approximately 19% of the company workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2008, we have total debt of $387.1 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $236.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $150 million 6 7/8% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2008 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2008 15 table of contents refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2007 and 2008, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock of ricon, poli and standard car truck for a combined $458.8 million, net of cash received. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 37 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company variable rate debt represents 61% and 0% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2008 would increase or decrease interest expense by $2.3 million. foreign currency exchange risk the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2008, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2009. at december 31, 2008, the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand (zar) and the purchase of u.s. dollars (usd). the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2008, the company had forward contracts with a notional value of $5.0 million zar (or $557,000 u.s.) with an average exchange rate of $8.97 zar per $1 usd, resulting in the recording of a current asset of $41,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $26,000, net of tax. at december 31, 2007, the company had forward contracts for the sale of usd and the purchase of euro with a notional value of 2.3 million euro (or $3.1 million usd), with an average exchange rate of $1.32 usd per 1 euro. these forward contracts are used to mitigate the variability in cash flows from the payment of liabilities denominated in currencies other than the usd. since the company does not treat these derivatives as hedges, the change in fair value of both the forward contracts and the related liabilities are recorded in the income statement. in 2007, the company recorded a fair value gain in the amount of $315,000. we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2008, approximately 59% of wabtec net sales were to the united states, 9% to canada, 3% to mexico, 5% to australia, 2% to germany, 11% to the united kingdom, and 11% in other international locations. (see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2007. 37 table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements, (sfas 157). sfas 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. the statement indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. sfas 157 defines fair value based upon an exit price model. relative to sfas 157, the fasb issued fasb staff positions (fsp) 157-1, 157-2, and 157-3. fsp 157-1 amends sfas 157 to exclude sfas 13 and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions, while fsp 157-2 delays the effective date of sfas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. fsp 157-3 clarifies the application of sfas 157 as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets. this fsp is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. the company does not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets, and as such is not impacted by the issuance of this fsp. the company adopted sfas 157 as of january 1, 2008, with the exception of the application of the statement to non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. refer to note 18 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on fair value measurements. in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no. 115 (sfas 159). sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007. the company adopted sfas 159 and has elected not to measure any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value. in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141 (revised), business combinations (sfas 141(r)), replacing sfas no. 141, business combinations (sfas 141), and sfas no. 160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no. 51 (sfas 160). sfas 141(r) retains the fundamental requirements of sfas 141, broadens its scope by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, and requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, that liabilities related to contingent consideration be recognized at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period, that acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that income be recognized if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred. sfas 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests (i.e., minority interests) in a subsidiary, including changes in a parent ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires, among other things, that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be classified as a separate component of equity. except for the presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas 160, which are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented, sfas 141(r) and sfas 160 are to be applied prospectively in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2008. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these statements. in march 2008, the fasb issued sfas no. 161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment fasb statement no. 133 (sfas 161). sfas 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. sfas 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities (sfas 133) as well as related hedged items, bifurcated derivatives, and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments. entities with instruments subject to sfas 161 must provide more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures. 38 table of contents sfas 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15, 2008, with early application permitted. the company is currently evaluating the disclosure implications of adopting this statement. in june 2008, the fasb issued fsp emerging issues task force ( eitf ) 03-6-1, determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities (fsp eitf 03-6-1). fsp eitf 03-6-1 states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. fsp eitf 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. upon adoption, a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of fsp eitf 03-6-1. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp eitf 03-6-1. in december 2008, the fasb issued fsp sfas no. 132(r)-1, employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets (fsp sfas 132(r)-1). fsp sfas 132(r)-1 amends sfas no. 132 (revised 2003), employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits , (sfas 132(r)), to provide guidance on an employer disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. the additional disclosure requirements under this fsp include expanded disclosures about an entity investment policies and

inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2009, approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, malaysia, mexico, poland, spain, south africa, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. 13 table of contents it is management belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the company wholly owned subsidiary, rfpc; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the company operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, management believes that the final resolution of the company asbestos-related cases will not be material to the company overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in general, this belief is based upon: (1) wabtec and rfpc history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss. more specifically, as to rfpc, management belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. to date, rfpc insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions. the overall number of new claims being filed against rfpc has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. as to wabtec and its divisions, management belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of wabtec assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. to date, wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed wabtec position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets. although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. 14 table of contents our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 37% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. agreements expiring in 2010 cover approximately 21% of the company workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2009, we had total debt of $391.8 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $241.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2008 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. 15 table of contents the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2008 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2008 and 2009, we completed the acquisition of poli, sct and unifin for a combined $482.6 million, net of cash received. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 37 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company variable rate debt represents 38% and 61% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2009 would increase or decrease interest expense by $1.5 million. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contract. the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. however, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. the counterparty is a large financial institution and the company does not anticipate nonperformance. the company concluded that the interest rate swap agreement qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2009, the company had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $92.5 million and which effectively changed the company interest rate on bank debt at december 31, 2009 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 1.84%. the interest rate swap agreement matures in january 2010. as of december 31, 2009, the company recorded a current liability of $63,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $38,000, net of tax. 37 table of contents foreign currency exchange risk the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2009, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2010. at december 31, 2009, the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand (zar) and the purchase of u.s. dollars (usd). the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2009, the company had forward contracts with a notional value of $10.1 million zar (or $1.2 million u.s.) with an average exchange rate of $8.21 zar per $1 usd, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $110,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $70,000, net of tax. at december 31, 2008, the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand (zar) and the purchase of u.s. dollars (usd). the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2008, the company had forward contracts with a notional value of $5.0 million zar (or $557,000 u.s.) with an average exchange rate of $8.97 zar per $1 usd, resulting in the recording of a current asset of $41,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $26,000, net of tax. we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2009, approximately 60% of wabtec net sales were to the united states, 10% to canada, 2% to mexico, 4% to australia, 2% to germany, 10% to the united kingdom, and 12% in other international locations. (see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2008.risk factors 11 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2010, our top five customers accounted for 18% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our 11 table of contents dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. in addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government 12 table of contents spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2010, approximately 46% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, malaysia, mexico, poland, spain, south africa, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. 13 table of contents most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. it is management belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the company wholly owned subsidiary, rfpc; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the company operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, management believes that the final resolution of the company asbestos-related cases will not be material to the company overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in general, this belief is based upon: (1) wabtec and rfpc history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss. more specifically, as to rfpc, management belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. to date, rfpc insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions. the overall number of new claims being filed against rfpc has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. as to wabtec and its divisions, management belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of wabtec assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. to date, wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed wabtec position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets. although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the 14 table of contents raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 28% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2011 through 2013. agreements expiring in 2011 cover approximately 11% of the company workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2010, we had total debt of $422.1 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $271.5 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. 15 table of contents the indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2008 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2008 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2009 and 2010, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $221.5 million. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company variable rate debt represents 32% and 38% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2010 would increase or decrease interest expense by $1.3 million. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contract. the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. however, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. the counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible. the company concluded that the interest rate swap agreement qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2010, the company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $137.0 million and which effectively changed the company interest rate on bank debt at december 31, 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.27%. the interest rate swap agreements mature at various times through december 2012. as of december 31, 2010, the company recorded a current liability of $2.5 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.5 million, net of tax. 38 table of contents foreign currency exchange risk the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. forward contracts are agreements with counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. as of december 31, 2010, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2010. at december 31, 2010, the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand (zar) and the purchase of u.s. dollars (usd). the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2010, the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 24.7 million zar (or $3.4 million u.s.) with an average exchange rate of 7.19 zar per $1 usd, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $192,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $122,000, net of tax. at december 31, 2009, the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand (zar) and the purchase of u.s. dollars (usd). the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2009, the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 10.1 million zar (or $1.2 million u.s.) with an average exchange rate of 8.21 zar per $1 usd, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $110,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $70,000, net of tax. we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2010, approximately 54% of wabtec net sales were to the united states, 11% to canada, 3% to mexico, 5% to australia, 2% to germany, 9% to the united kingdom, and 16% in other international locations. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2009.risk factors 12 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011, our top five customers accounted for 17% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. 12 table of contents as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. in addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control (ptc) mandate from the u.s. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by december 31, 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2011, we had sales of about $125 million related to ptc. as part of its new surface transportation funding bill, a house committee has proposed extending the ptc deadline to december 31, 2020, which could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology. should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing, scope or requirements of the safety bill, there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods, and would cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2011, approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, austria, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, malaysia, mexico, poland, spain, south africa, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; 13 table of contents lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. it is management belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the company wholly owned subsidiary, rfpc; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the company operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, management believes that the final resolution of the company asbestos-related cases will not be material to the company overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in general, this belief is based upon: (1) wabtec and rfpc history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss. more specifically, as to rfpc, management belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. to date, rfpc insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions. the overall number of new claims being filed against rfpc has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. as to wabtec and its divisions, management belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on 14 table of contents its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of wabtec assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. to date, wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed wabtec position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets. although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 25% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2012 through 2014. agreements expiring at various times during 2012 cover approximately 17% of the company workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills 15 table of contents to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2011, we had total debt of $395.9 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement, along with carrying the $245.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2011 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the 2011 refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2011 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2010 and 2011, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $235.8 million. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, 16 table of contents including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company variable rate debt represents 35% and 32% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2011 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $1.4 million. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed- 42 table of contents rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk. foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2011, approximately 53% of wabtec net sales were to the united states, 9% to the united kingdom, 8% to canada, 6% to australia, 5% to mexico, 2% to germany, and 17% in other international locations. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2010.risk factors 12 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key

products. our manufacturer warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 27% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2013 through 2015. agreements expiring at various times during 2013 cover approximately 16% of the company workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2012, we had total debt of $317.9 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement, the $167.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. 15 table of contents the indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2011 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management discretion. the 2011 refinancing credit agreement limits the company ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2011 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2011 and 2012, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $258.8 million. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company variable rate debt represents 53% and 35% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2012 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $1.7 million. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk. foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2012, approximately 50% of wabtec net sales were to the united states, 11% to the united kingdom, 8% to canada, 8% to australia, 6% to mexico, 2% to germany, and 15% in other international locations. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency 42 table of contents forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2011.risk factors 10 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended decembe r 31, 2013, our top five customers accounted for 15% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. 10 our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. in addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control (ptc) mandate from the u.s. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by december 31, 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2013 , we had sales of about $235 million related to ptc. in recent years, the railroads and transit authorities have stated they cannot achieve full implementation of ptc by the deadline, and various bills have been introduced to extend it, but to date there has been no change in the deadline. should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing, scope or requirements of the safety bill, there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods, and would cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in frei ght traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a 11 substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods. instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of ou r customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 201 3, approximately 48% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, austria, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, mexico, the netherlands, poland, spain, south africa, turkey, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united state by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. 12 we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislatio n on the company's operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a

$200.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $250.0 million 4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the

developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. 12 labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 28% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2015 through 2017. agreements expiring at various times during 2015 cover approximately 21% of the company's workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2014, we had total debt of $521.8 million. if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2013 refinancing credit agreement, the $270.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $250.0 million 4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $250 million 4.375% senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion in the operation of our businesses. the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio. the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2013 and 2014, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $522.2 million. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; 13 diversion of management's attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company's variable rate debt represents 23% and 11% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2014 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $1.2 million. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk. foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2014, approximately 50% of wabtec's net sales were to the united states, 12% to the united kingdom, 6% to canada, 6% to mexico, 4% to australia, 3% to brazil, 3% to germany, 3% to china, and 13% in other international locations. (see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. 35 our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2013.risk factors 10 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015 , our top five customers accounted for 22% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. in addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. 10 a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control (ptc) mandate from the u.s. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018. for the year ended december 31, 2015 , we had sales of about $400 million related to ptc. in 2015, the industry's ptc deadline was extended by three years, which could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. a substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods. instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2015 , approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, austria, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, mexico, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, south africa, turkey, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. 11 we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company's operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or

agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately 26% of the company's workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt

in contractual disputes with our customers. from time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. these disputes are generally resolved in 12 the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us although we cannot guarantee that this will continue to occur. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2015 , we had total debt of $695.7 million . if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2013 refinancing credit agreement, the $445.0 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $250.0 million 4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our

restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. the occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business, customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders, product liability, intellectual property infringement, warranty claims or environmental-related matters. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims. any litigation, even a claim without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks, we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the french law n 2016-1691 (sapin ii) and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, we may be adversely affected. our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. we rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. however, a significant portion of our 13 technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. moreover, existing u.s. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted. our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 35% of our employees. our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2017 through 2019. agreements expiring at various times during 2017 cover approximately 20% of the company's workforce. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2016 , we had total debt of $1,892.8 million . if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2016 refinancing credit agreement, the $796.2 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $747.5 million 3.450% senior notes, and the $248.3 million 4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $747.5 million 3.450% senior notes due in 2026, our $248.3 million 4.375% senior notes due in 2023, and our 2016 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion in the operation of our businesses. the 2016 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2016 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, 14 loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio. the indentures under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2015 and 2016, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $996.0 million , which included our acquisition of a 51% controlling stake in faiveley transport for $746.5 million . additionally, we launched a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded shares with the intention of acquiring 100% ownership of faiveley transport and currently having a 78% controlling interest. although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management's attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company's variable rate debt represents 36% and 42% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. on an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2016 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $6.8 million . to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk. foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2016 , approximately 46% 40 of wabtec's net sales were in the united states, 11% in the united kingdom, 7% in canada, 6% in mexico, 4% in china, 3% in australia, 3% in germany, 2% in brazil, and 18% in other international locations. (see note 20 of notes in consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2015 .risk factors 11 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. our top customers can change from year to year. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017 , our top five customers accounted for approximately 18% of our net sales. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a global, competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. as we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business. we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. in addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. 11 a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control (ptc) mandate from the u.s. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018. for the year ended december 31, 2017 , we had sales of about $322 million related to train control and signaling, which includes ptc. in 2015, the industry's ptc deadline was extended by three years through december 31, 2018, which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met. this could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods. instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. in fiscal year 2017 , approximately 66% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the u.s. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france, and we currently conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia, austria, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, mexico, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, south africa, turkey, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against american interests. in addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-u.s. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows. 12 we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation (rfpc), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company's operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. the occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business, customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders, product liability, intellectual property infringement, warranty claims or environmental-related matters. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims. any litigation, even a claim without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks, we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the french law n 2016-1691 (sapin ii) and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, we may be adversely affected. our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. we rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. however, a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. moreover, 13 existing u.s. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems. attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations. we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include employee education, password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place and frequent backups; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, customers and supplier, and potentially violate certain domestic and international privacy laws. furthermore, a cybersecurity attack on our customers and suppliers could compromise our confidential information in the possession of our customers and suppliers. a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations, including through lawsuits by third-parties. our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. furthermore, non-union employees in certain countries have the right to strike. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. being indebted could have important consequences to us. at december 31, 2017 , we had total debt of $1,870.5 million . if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2016 refinancing credit agreement, the $853.1 million currently borrowed under this facility and the $747.7 million 3.450% senior notes, and the $248.6 million 4.375% senior notes. for example, it could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. 14 the indenture for our $750 million 3.450% senior notes due in 2026, our $250 million 4.375% senior notes due in 2023, and our 2016 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion in the operation of our businesses. the 2016 refinancing credit agreement limits the company's ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. the 2016 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and see note 8 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" included in part iv, item 15 of this report. the indentures under which the senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. in 2016 and 2017, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $1,865 million , which included our acquisition of faiveley transport for $1,507 million . although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management's attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company's variable rate debt represents 38% and 36% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. on an annual basis, a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2017 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $7.1 million. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk. foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2017 , approximately 34% of wabtec's net sales were in the united states, 9% in the united kingdom, 7% in canada, 6% in france, 5% in china, 5% in germany, 4% in australia, 4% in mexico, 4% in india, 4% in italy, 2% in brazil, and 16% in other international locations. (see note 20 of notes in consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2016 .risk factors 11 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally, particularly in our key end markets, could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations. furthermore, the average service life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes, which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a global, competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do, may have a more extensive low-cost sourcing strategy and presence in low-cost regions than we do or may receive significant governmental support. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. if our competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than our products, we may not be able to compete effectively. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition, joint venture or alliance. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions, joint ventures or alliances, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in such strategic transactions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement this strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business. if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our existing products or to react appropriately to changes in demand, we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction. if demand increases significantly from current levels, both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand, particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly. alternatively, we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels. additionally, we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer 11 acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. furthermore, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. failure to accurately predict and react to customer demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to respond adequately or in a timely manner to innovative changes in new technology. in recent years, the global transportation landscape has been characterized by rapid changes in technology, leading to innovative transportation and logistics concepts that could change the way the railway industry does business. there may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that we cannot yet foresee. any failure by us to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by our customers may result in a significant loss of demand for our product and service offerings. in addition, advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments. a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ("ptc") mandate from the u.s. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 , we had sales of about $395 million related to train control and signaling, which includes ptc. in 2015, the industry's ptc deadline was extended by three years through december 31, 2018, which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met. this could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering ptc services. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects. in economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical and is influenced by a variety of factors. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced by a variety of factors, including major replacement programs, the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities and the quality and cost of alternative modes of transportation. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods. instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018 , approximately 67% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the united states. we intend to continue to expand our international operations, including in emerging markets, in the future. our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france, and we conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, including in australia, austria, brazil, canada, 12 china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, mexico, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, south africa, turkey, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital; the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; adverse impacts of international trade policies, such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the challenges of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations, and policies of foreign governments; the difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; economic, political and social instability; and possible terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars, including those against american interests. our exposure to the risks associated with international operations may intensify if our international operations expand in the future. we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation. claims have been filed against us and certain of our affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, railroad friction products corporation ("rfpc"), and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that we acquired any interest in rfpc. most of these claims, including all of the rfpc claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that have retained the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. we cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated. we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, in various jurisdictions. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the french law n 2016-1691 (sapin ii) and the u.k. bribery act, relating to our business and our employees. we are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the u.s. department of commerce's bureau of industry and security, the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control, and various non-u.s. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations, and transfer pricing regulations. despite our policies, procedures and compliance programs, our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect us from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage our reputation, subject us to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt our business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance and mechanical standards, rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally. our business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of our products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives. we are unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have, if any, on our business or the industry as a whole. we cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, substances in products, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we have incurred, and will continue to incur, both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including costs associated with the clean-up and 13 investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations, injunctive relief (including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities), and reputational risk. in addition, certain of our products are subject to extensive, and increasingly stringent, statutory and regulatory requirements governing, e.g. , emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the u.s. environmental protection agency, the european union and other regulatory agencies around the world. we have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards. the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. in addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standards-particularly in emerging markets-are unpredictable and subject to change. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. we have followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. we have reviewed the potential challenges for us that climate change policy and legislation may pose. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on our operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. the occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable. from time to time, we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business, customers, suppliers, creditors, stockholders, product liability, intellectual property infringement, warranty claims or environmental-related matters. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims. any litigation, even a claim without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks, we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all. if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, we may be adversely affected. our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. we rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. however, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. moreover, existing u.s. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, a significant portion of our technology is not patented, and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. further, although we routinely conduct anti-counterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions, we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact our brand value. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, counterfeiting or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 14 in addition, we operate in industries in which there are many third-party owners of intellectual property rights. owners of intellectual property that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable. third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against us based on their intellectual property portfolios. if we are sued for intellectual property infringement, we may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if we prevail. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business. in addition, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business. cybersecurity attacks could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems. attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations. we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include employee education, password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place and frequent backups; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, customers and suppliers, and potentially violate certain domestic and international privacy laws. furthermore, a cybersecurity attack on our customers and suppliers could compromise our confidential information in the possession of our customers and suppliers. a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations, including through lawsuits by third-parties. in addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor shortages and labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses. due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, we may not be able to retain, recruit and train the personnel we require, particularly when the economy expands, production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases. we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. furthermore, non-union employees in certain countries have the right to strike. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. equipment failures, interruptions, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems, could adversely affect our business. all of our facilities, equipment, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornados, hurricanes or weather conditions. an interruption in our manufacturing capabilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems, whether as a result of such catastrophic loss or any other reason, could reduce, prevent or delay our production and shipment of our product offerings, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. this could result in the delay or termination of orders, the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our customers. third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to such matters will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to 15 protect us against losses. any of these risks coming to fruition could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may be exposed to raw material shortages, supply shortages and fluctuations in raw material, energy and commodity prices. we purchase energy, steel, aluminum, copper, rubber and rubber-based materials, chemicals, polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources, and traditionally have not had long-term pricing contracts with our pure raw material suppliers. the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control. if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers, experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers, or operational efficiencies are not achieved, our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. our businesses compete globally for key production inputs. in addition, we rely upon third-party suppliers, including certain single-sourced suppliers, for various components for our products. in the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs, we may experience challenges sourcing certain of our components to meet our production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs. any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa. in addition, a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could reduce our profits from non-u.s. operations and the translated value of the net assets of our non-u.s. operations when reported in u.s. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. if we lose our senior management or key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected. the success of our business is largely dependent on our senior management team, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other qualified key personnel. it cannot be assured that we will be able to retain all of our current senior management personnel and attract and retain other key personnel necessary for the development of our business. the loss of the services of senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. following the consummation of the acquisition of ge transportation, we will have substantial operations located in india, and will be subject to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties in india. although we currently have operations in india, following the consummation of our acquisition of ge transportation, these operations will be substantially more significant, including a large-scale project involving the construction of a factory in the state of bihar, which includes a township to house employees. the project also includes construction of two service sheds, in the states of uttar pradesh and gujarat. operations in india are inherently risky due to a number of regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties. for example, in september 2017, several media outlets reported that the indian government expressed a desire to switch the country's rail system from diesel to electric locomotives, which would threaten to interfere with the completion of the project and curtail the viability of our ongoing operations in india. while no such actions have been taken to date, any change in policy with respect to india's rail system could have a material adverse effect on the business of the combined company. in addition, the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy. since 1991, successive indian governments have generally pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms, including by significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector. nevertheless, the role of the indian central and state governments in the indian economy as producers, consumers and regulators has remained significant and we cannot assure you that such liberalization policies will continue. the rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting foreign investments in india could change as well, including exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other governmental actions. further, protests against privatizations and government corruption scandals, which have occurred in the past, could slow the pace of liberalization and deregulation. a significant change in india's policy of economic liberalization and deregulation or 16 any social or political uncertainties could significantly harm business and economic conditions in india generally and our business and prospects. india's physical infrastructure is less developed than that of many developed nations. any congestion or disruption with respect to communication systems or any public facility, including transportation infrastructure, could disrupt our normal business activity. any deterioration of india's physical infrastructure would harm the national economy, disrupt the transportation of people, goods and supplies, and add costs to doing business in india. these disruptions could interrupt our business operations and significantly harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2018 , we had total debt of $3,856.9 million . we entered into a credit agreement, as amended, dated june 8, 2018, by and among us, wabtec netherlands b.v, the other borrowing subsidiaries party thereto from time to time, pnc bank, national association, as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto, which includes (i) a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, (ii) a $350.0 million refinancing term loan and (iii) a $400.0 million delayed draw term loan. being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, our indebtedness could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indenture for our $500.0 million floating rate senior notes due in 2021, our $744.4 million 4.375% senior notes due in 2023, our $499.1 million 4.150% senior notes due in 2024, our $750.0 million 3.450% senior notes due in 2026, our $1.25 billion 4.700% senior notes due in 2028 and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion in the operation of our businesses. our credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties by us and our subsidiaries, including customary use of materiality, material adverse effect, and knowledge qualifiers. we and our subsidiaries are also subject to (i) customary affirmative covenants that impose certain reporting obligations on us and our subsidiaries and (ii) customary negative covenants, including limitations on: indebtedness; liens; restricted payments; fundamental changes; business activities; transactions with affiliates; restrictive agreements; changes in fiscal year; and use of proceeds. in addition, we are required to maintain (i) a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 3.00 to 1.00 over each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter and (ii) a leverage ratio, calculated as of the last day of a fiscal quarter for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of 3.25 to 1.00 or less; provided that, any material acquisition in which the cash consideration paid exceeds $500.0 million, the maximum leverage ratio permitted will be (x) 3.75 to 1.00 at the end of the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is consummated and each of the three fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter and (y) 3.50 to 1.00 at the end of each of the fourth and fifth full fiscal quarters after the consummation of such acquisition. the indenture under which our senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: sale and leaseback transactions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. although we believe that our recent acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management's attention; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. 17 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company's variable rate debt represents 22% and 38% of total long-term debt at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk. foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2018 , approximately 33% of wabtec's net sales were in the united states, 9% in the united kingdom, 7% in germany, 6% in canada, 6% in france, 5% in mexico, 4% in china, 4% in australia, 4% in india, 4% in italy, 2% in brazil, and 16% in other international locations. (see note 22 of notes in consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2018 .risk factors 11 risk factors prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business. unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally, particularly in our key end markets, could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we are dependent upon key customers. we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. in addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. as a result, customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations. furthermore, the average service life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes, which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often. as a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products. our business operates in a highly competitive industry. we operate in a global, competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do, may have a more extensive low-cost sourcing strategy and presence in low-cost regions than we do or may receive significant governmental support. price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. in addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. if our competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than our products, we may not be able to compete effectively. there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations. 11 we intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits. one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including: difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the assumption of unknown liabilities; and unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition, joint venture or alliance. we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. if we are unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions, joint ventures or alliances, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. in addition, our ability to engage in such strategic transactions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement this strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business. if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our existing products or to react appropriately to changes in demand, we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction. if demand increases significantly from current levels, both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand, particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly. alternatively, we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels. additionally, we have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. furthermore, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers. failure to accurately predict and react to customer demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to respond adequately or in a timely manner to innovative changes in new technology. in recent years, the global transportation landscape has been characterized by rapid changes in technology, leading to innovative transportation and logistics concepts that could change the way the railway industry does business. there may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that we cannot yet foresee. any failure by us to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by our customers may result in a significant loss of demand for our product and service offerings. in addition, advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments. a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our u.s. railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control mandate from the u.s. federal government. in 2015, the u.s. rail industry's ptc deadline was extended by congress by three years through december 31, 2018, which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met. the department of transportation has largely granted the additional two years for compliance. all freight railroads are required to have testing complete and positive train control fully implemented across the required network by december 31, 2020. these extensions could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering ptc services to our customers. our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending. the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects. in economic downturns, 12 railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products. the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical and is influenced by a variety of factors. new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced by a variety of factors, including major replacement programs, the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities and the quality and cost of alternative modes of transportation. to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or canceled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us. our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods. instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level. for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, approximately 60% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the united states. we intend to continue to expand our international operations, including in emerging markets, in the future. our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france, and we conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, including in australia, austria, brazil, canada, china, czech republic, france, germany, india, italy, macedonia, mexico, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, south africa, turkey, and the united kingdom. as a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including: lack of complete operating control; lack of local business experience; currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital; the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions; foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls; adverse impacts of international trade policies, such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs; difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights; the challenges of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations, and policies of foreign governments; the difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; economic, political and social instability; possible local catastrophes, such as natural disasters and epidemics; and possible terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars, including those against american interests. our exposure to the risks associated with international operations may intensify if our international operations expand in the future. we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, in various jurisdictions. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the french law n 2016-1691 (sapin ii) and the u.k. bribery act, relating to our business and our employees. we are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the u.s. department of commerce's bureau of industry and security, the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control, and various non-u.s. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, 13 currency exchange regulations, and transfer pricing regulations. despite our policies, procedures and compliance programs, our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect us from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage our reputation, subject us to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt our business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance and mechanical standards, rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally. our business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of our products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives. we are unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have, if any, on our business or the industry as a whole. we cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations. we are subject to a variety of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, substances in products, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. we have incurred, and will continue to incur, both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including costs associated with the clean-up and investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations. we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations, injunctive relief (including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities), and reputational risk. in addition, certain of our products are subject to extensive, and increasingly stringent, statutory and regulatory requirements governing, e.g. , emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the u.s. environmental protection agency, the european union and other regulatory agencies around the world. we have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards. the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. in addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standards-particularly in emerging markets-are unpredictable and subject to change. future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs. we have followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. we have reviewed the potential challenges for us that climate change policy and legislation may pose. any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. at this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on our operations. further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. in addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products. the occurrence of litigation in which we are, or could be, named as a defendant is unpredictable. from time to time, we are subject, directly or through our subsidiaries, to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business, customers, suppliers, creditors, stockholders, product liability (including, asbestos claims), intellectual property infringement, competition and antitrust claims, warranty claims or environmental-related matters. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims. although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks, we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all. in addition, although in some cases we may be indemnified by non-affiliated entities that retain liabilities in connection with specific 14 matters, there can be no assurance that these indemnitors will remain financially viable and capable of satisfying their obligations. any litigation, even a claim without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, we may be adversely affected. our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. we rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. however, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. moreover, existing u.s. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, a significant portion of our technology is not patented, and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. further, although we routinely conduct anti-counterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions, we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact our brand value. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, counterfeiting or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. in addition, we operate in industries in which there are many third-party owners of intellectual property rights. owners of intellectual property that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable. third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against us based on their intellectual property portfolios. if we are sued for intellectual property infringement, we may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if we prevail. we face cybersecurity and data protection risks relating to cyber attacks and information technology failures that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. we rely extensively on information technology in our business. we also collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed data protection controls. we also provide technological products integral to train operation. accordingly, our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology infrastructure, which could result from individual or highly-coordinated cyber attacks, including but not limited to data theft, system breaches, malfeasance or improper use or unauthorized access to it systems. our business may also be adversely impacted by unintentional technology disruptions, including those resulting from programming errors, employee operational errors and software defects. our manufacturer's warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims. we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers' specifications. in addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation. labor shortages and labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. we depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses. due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, we may not be able to retain, recruit and train the personnel we require, particularly when the economy expands, production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases. we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world. failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. furthermore, non-union employees in certain countries have the right to strike. if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business. 15 equipment failures, interruptions, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems, could adversely affect our business. all of our facilities, equipment, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as disease outbreak, fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes or weather conditions. an interruption in our manufacturing capabilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems, whether as a result of such catastrophic loss or any other reason, could reduce, prevent or delay our production and shipment of our product offerings, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. this could result in the delay or termination of orders, the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our customers. third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to such matters will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses. any of these risks coming to fruition could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may be exposed to raw material shortages, supply shortages and fluctuations in raw material, energy and commodity prices. we purchase energy, steel, aluminum, copper, rubber and rubber-based materials, chemicals, polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources, and traditionally have not had long-term pricing contracts with our pure raw material suppliers. the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control. if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers, experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers, or operational efficiencies are not achieved, our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. our businesses compete globally for key production inputs. in addition, we rely upon third-party suppliers, including certain single-sourced suppliers, for various components for our products. in the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs, we may experience challenges sourcing certain of our components to meet our production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs. any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs. changes to international trade policies, including tariffs and foreign trade restrictions, could adversely affect our business. as a global transportation company, we generate export sales from our u.s. operations and also derive international sales through our foreign subsidiaries, licensees and joint ventures. we also do business with industry suppliers located in various international markets. a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may adversely affect our business. in particular, such policies may impact or delay our customers' investments in our products, reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain markets, and inhibit our ability to cost-effectively purchase necessary inputs from certain suppliers. in addition, to the extent developments in international trade relations result in reduced global trade or slower growth in global trade, it is likely that this would result in reductions in investment in freight and transit rail. international trade policies are affected by a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. although we actively monitor developments in international trade and proactively engage in efforts to mitigate the effect of trade policies, there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful. we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa. in addition, a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could reduce our profits from non-u.s. operations and the translated value of the net assets of our non-u.s. operations when reported in u.s. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us. if we lose our senior management or key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected. the success of our business is largely dependent on our senior management team, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other qualified key personnel. it cannot be assured that we will be able to retain all of our current senior management personnel and attract and retain other key personnel necessary for the development of our business. the loss of the services of 16 senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we have substantial operations located in emerging markets, and are subject to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties in such markets. we have substantial operations located in emerging markets, such as brazil, india, kazakhstan, the russian federation and ukraine. operations in such emerging markets are inherently risky due to a number of regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties. these risks include economies that may be dependent on only a few products and are therefore subject to significant fluctuations, weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights, possible exchange controls, unstable governments, nationalization or privatization actions or other government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency. significant changes in economic and regulatory policy in emerging countries as well as social or political uncertainties could significantly harm business and economic conditions in these markets generally and could disproportionately impact the rail industry, which could adversely affect our business and prospects in these markets. in addition, physical and financial infrastructure may be less developed in some emerging countries than that of many developed nations. any disruptions with respect to banking and financial infrastructure, communication systems or any public facility, including transportation infrastructure, could disrupt our normal business activity. such disruptions could interrupt our business operations and significantly harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health. at december 31, 2019, we had total debt of $4.4 billion, including $3.5 billion related to senior notes and $0.9 billion related to term loans and amounts drawn under our revolving loan facility, in each case, under the senior credit facility. being indebted could have important consequences to us. for example, our indebtedness could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. the indentures for our outstanding senior notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management's discretion in the operation of our businesses. our credit agreement subjects us to customary (i) affirmative covenants, including requirements with respect to certain reporting obligations on us and our subsidiaries, and (ii) negative covenants, including limitations on: indebtedness; liens; restricted payments; fundamental changes (including certain changes in control); business activities; transactions with affiliates; restrictive agreements; changes in fiscal year; and use of proceeds. in addition, we are required to maintain (i) a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 3.00 to 1.00 over each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter and (ii) a leverage ratio, calculated as of the last day of a fiscal quarter for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of 3.25 to 1.00 or less; provided that, in connection with the acquisition of ge transportation and in the event of any further material acquisition in which the cash consideration to be paid exceeds $500.0 million, the maximum leverage ratio permitted adjusts to (x) 3.75 to 1.00 at the end of the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is consummated and each of the three fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter and (y) 3.50 to 1.00 at the end of each of the fourth and fifth full fiscal quarters after the consummation of such acquisition. the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit, subject to certain exceptions, certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties, the incurrence of secured debt without equally and ratably securing the senior notes and certain merger and consolidation transactions. in addition, the indentures require that we offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events. the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected. although we believe that our recent acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these 17 improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including: the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results; significant expenses to integrate; diversion of management's attention from business operations to integration matters; departure of key personnel from the acquired business; effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making; integration of different information systems; unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and impairment of assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business, wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. the company's variable rate debt represents 32% and 22% of total debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. on an annual basis, a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31, 2019, would increase or decrease interest expense by about $14 million. foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is exposed to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2019, approximately 41% of wabtec's net sales were in the united states, 9% in canada, 6% in india, 5% in the united kingdom, 4% in mexico, 4% in germany, 4% in australia, 4% in france, 4% in china, and 19% in other international locations. (see note 21 of notes in consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report). to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. refer to financial derivatives and hedging activities in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv, item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk. our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31, 2019.
