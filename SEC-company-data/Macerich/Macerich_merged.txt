debt of $1.3 million . the shopping center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers," "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the 6 table of contents shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages three regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). 7 table of contents development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). the centers: as of december 31, 2013 , the centers, excluding the 2014 disposition center, consisted of 54 regional shopping centers and nine community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 56 million square feet of gla. the 54 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 945,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.1 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 243,000 square feet of gla at tucson la encantada . the company's nine community/power shopping centers have an average of approximately 429,000 square feet of gla. as of december 31, 2013 , excluding the 2014 disposition center, the centers included 210 anchors totaling approximately 29.2 million square feet of gla and approximately 6,200 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 27.3 million square feet of gla. competition: there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies or investors, and financial buyers compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants: the centers derived approximately 74% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2013 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet. big box and anchor tenants accounted for 26% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2013 . the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest rent payers in the centers, excluding the 2014

_________________________ (1) total rents include minimum rents and percentage rents. mall stores and freestanding stores: mall store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company has generally entered into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. additionally, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2013 comprises approximately 65% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. most of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 9

base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. currently, 68% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. the leases for paradise valley mall were excluded as this property is under redevelopment. anchors: anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 6.8% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2013 . 13 table of contents the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such anchor or parent company in the company's portfolio, excluding the 2014 disposition center, at december 31, 2013 . name

sites. the company continues to collect rent under terms of an agreement on one of these vacant locations. (2) the company owns a portfolio of 14 stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these 14 stores, four have been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to burlington coat factory, one has been leased to kohl's and eight have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars) because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. the terrorism risk insurance act (or tria), which creates a federally-funded backstop for terrorism-related insurance claims, is set to expire on december 31, 2014. although it is expected that tria will be extended by congress, if tria expires, then the number of insurers offering terrorism insurance will likely decrease and/or the cost to purchase terrorism insurance will increase. 15 table of contents qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2013 , the company had approximately 1,143 employees, of which approximately 980 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a discussion of the extent to which the company's business may be seasonal, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona, and ten centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies or investors, and financial buyers compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet 17 table of contents shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have gone out of business. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. 18 table of contents our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carry terrorism insurance on 19 table of contents the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. the terrorism risk insurance act (or tria), which creates a federally-funded backstop for terrorism-related insurance claims, is set to expire on december 31, 2014. although it is expected that tria will be extended by congress, if tria expires, then the number of insurers offering terrorism insurance will likely decrease and/or the cost to purchase terrorism insurance will increase. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2013 was $6.0 billion (consisting of $4.6 billion of consolidated debt, less $0.3 billion attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $1.7 billion of our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). approximately $119.0 million of such indebtedness (at our pro rata share) matures in 2014. as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. 20 table of contents we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 24 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. 21 table of contents an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all three principals who serve as one of our executive officers and directors). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law. some of the provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. in addition, t he maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two supermajority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. 22 table of contents the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, the maryland general corporation law permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our 23 table of contents stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us or our investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2013 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and

billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was 4.25% and 4.40% , respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on floating rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was 2.59% and 3.05% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was 4.60% and 5.27% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was $115.9 million and $178.3 million , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2013 and 2012 was 2.59% and 3.69% , respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2013 , the company did not have any interest rate cap or swap agreements in place. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $5.8 million per year based on $584.7 million of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2013 . the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral 57 table of contents for the underlying debt (see note 10 mortgage notes payable and note 11 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements).risk factors 17 risk factors" of this

loan servicer, which is expected to result in a transition of the property to the loan servicer or a receiver. consequently, great northern mall has been excluded from certain 2014 performance metrics and related discussions in this "item 1. business", including major tenants, average base rents, cost of occupancy, lease expirations and anchors (see "major tenants", "mall stores and freestanding stores", "cost of occupancy", "lease expirations", and "anchors" below). in addition, great northern mall has been excluded from the company's list of properties and related computations of gla, occupancy and sales per square foot (see "item 2. properties"). the shopping center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers," "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet of gla are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. 6 regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. the company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages three regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). the centers: as of december 31, 2014 , the centers primarily included 51 regional shopping centers, excluding great northern mall , and eight community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 54 million square feet of gla. these 59 centers average approximately 921,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.7 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 185,000 square feet of gla at boulevard shops . as of december 31, 2014 , excluding great northern mall , the centers primarily included 194 anchors totaling approximately 27.6 million square feet of gla and approximately 6,000 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 24.9 million square feet of gla. 7 competition: numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with the company in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants: the centers, excluding great northern mall , derived approximately 74% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2014 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet, and big box and anchor tenants accounted for 26% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2014 . total rents as set forth in "item 1. business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest rent payers in the centers, excluding great northern mall , based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2014 : tenant primary dbas number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents l brands, inc. victoria's secret,

american eagle outfitters, inc. american eagle outfitters, aerie 37 1.2 % express, inc. express, express / express men 30 1.1 % 8 mall stores and freestanding stores: mall store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company generally enters into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. however, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2014 , excluding great northern mall , comprises approximately 67% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. most of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the past five years: mall

_____________________ (1) average base rent per square foot is based on spaces occupied as of december 31 for each of the centers and gives effect to the terms of each lease in effect, as of such date, including any concessions, abatements and other adjustments or allowances that have been granted to the tenants. (2) centers under development and redevelopment are excluded from average base rents. as a result, the leases for broadway plaza, fashion outlets of niagara falls usa, the gallery, paradise valley mall, southpark mall and westside pavilion were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2014. the leases for paradise valley mall were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2013. the leases for the shops at atlas park and southridge center were excluded for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011. the leases for santa monica place were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2010. in addition, the leases for rotterdam square, which was sold on january 15, 2014, were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2013. furthermore, the leases for great northern mall, which is in maturity default, were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2014 and the leases for valley view center, which was sold by a court-appointed receiver in 2012, were excluded for the years ended december 31, 2011 and 2010. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the year represents the actual rent paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months of the lease. (4) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. 10 cost of occupancy: a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for the years ended december 31, 2014(1) 2013 (2) 2012 2011 2010 consolidated centers: minimum rents 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.2 % 8.6 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(3) 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.2 % 4.1 % 4.4 % 13.4 % 13.3 % 12.7 % 12.8 % 13.4 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 8.7 % 8.8 % 8.9 % 9.1 % 9.1 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(3) 4.5 % 4.0 % 3.9 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 13.6 % 13.2 % 13.2 % 13.4 % 13.5 % _____________________________ (1) great northern mall is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2014 .

period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. currently, 71% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. the leases for centers currently under development and redevelopment are excluded from this table. anchors: anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 8.5% of the company's

(1) sears closed its store at cascade mall in january 2015. (2) dick's sporting goods plans to open a new store at scottsdale fashion square , southpark mall and los cerritos center in late 2015. (3) century 21 plans to open a 70,000 square foot two-level department store at green acres mall in fall 2015. (4) the company is seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. the company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding one of these four vacant anchor locations. (5) the company owns a portfolio of nine stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these nine stores, two have been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to kohl's and six have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. 15 qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2014 , the company had approximately 1,117 employees, of which approximately 976 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a discussion of the

monica, ca 90401 16 item 1a. risk factors the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona. nine centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with us for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with us in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from 17 other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have gone out of business. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. 18 our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual 19 aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems. we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2014 was $7.1 billion (consisting of $6.3 billion of consolidated debt, less $0.2 billion attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $1.0 billion of our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). approximately $406.8 million of such indebtedness (at our pro rata share) matures in 2015 . 20 as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 16 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. 21 our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain of our charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit, among other purposes, our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law. some of the provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and 22 limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. in addition, the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two supermajority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, the maryland general corporation law permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to adopt certain charter and bylaw provisions, such as a classified board, that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and 23 we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us or our investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2014 concerning the company's long term debt obligations,

centers' total fixed rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $5.2 billion and $4.1 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 3.63% and 4.25% , respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 2.11% and 2.59% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 4.50% and 4.60% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $115.4 million and $115.9 million , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 2.59% . the company has used derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2014 , the company did not have any interest rate cap or swap agreements in place. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $12.4 million per year based on $1.2 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2014 . the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 8 mortgage notes payable and note 9 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). 57risk factors 18 risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k, as well as our other reports filed with the securities and exchange

( simon ) to acquire the company. the company's board of directors, after consulting with its financial, real estate and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the simon proposal substantially undervalued the company and was not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. on march 20, 2015, the company received a revised, unsolicited proposal to acquire the company from simon, which simon described as its best and final proposal. the company's board of directors carefully reviewed the revised proposal with the assistance of its financial, real estate and legal advisors, and determined that the revised proposal continued to substantially undervalue the company and that pursuing the proposed transaction at that time was not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. on june 30, 2015 , the company conveyed great northern mall , an 895,000 square foot regional shopping center in clay , new york , to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. the mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. as a result, the company recognized a loss of $1.6 million on the extinguishment of debt. on september 30, 2015 , the company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of the company's outstanding common shares over the period ending september 30, 2017 , as market conditions warrant. on november 12, 2015 , the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("asr") to repurchase $400.0 million of the company's common stock. in accordance with the asr, the company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 4,140,788 shares. on january 20, 2016 , the asr was completed and the company received an additional delivery of 970,609 shares. the average price of the 5,111,397 shares repurchased under the asr was $78.26 per share. the asr was funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of the ownership interest in the ppr portfolio (see "acquisitions and dispositions" and "financing activity" in recent developments). on october 30, 2015, the company declared two special dividends/distributions ("special dividend"), each of $2.00 per share of common stock and per operating partnership unit ("op unit"). the first special dividend was paid on december 8, 2015 to stockholders and op unit holders of record on november 12, 2015. the second special dividend was paid on january 6, 2016 to common stockholders and op unit holders of record on november 12, 2015. the special dividends were funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of ownership interests in the ppr portfolio and arrowhead towne center (see "acquisitions and dispositions" and "financing activity" in recent developments). on november 1, 2015 , the mortgage note payable on flagstaff mall , a 347,000 square foot regional shopping center in flagstaff , arizona , went into maturity default. the mortgage note payable is a non-recourse loan. the company is negotiating with the loan servicer, which will likely result in a transition of the property to the loan servicer or a receiver. consequently, flagstaff mall has been excluded from certain 2015 performance metrics and related discussions in this "item 1. business", including major tenants, average base rents, cost of occupancy, lease expirations and anchors (see "major tenants", "mall stores and freestanding stores", "cost of occupancy", "lease expirations", and "anchors" below). in addition, flagstaff mall has been excluded from the company's list of properties and related computations of gla, occupancy and sales per square foot (see "item 2. properties"). on february 17, 2016 , the company entered into an asr to repurchase $400.0 million of the company's common stock. in accordance with the asr, the company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 4,222,193 shares. the company expects to complete the asr on or before april 22, 2016 . the asr was funded from borrowings under the company's line of credit, which had been recently paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed financings and sale of ownership interests (see "acquisitions and dispositions" and "financing activity" in recent developments). 6 the shopping center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet of gla are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. 7 the company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages two regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). the centers: as of december 31, 2015 , the centers primarily included 50 regional shopping centers, excluding flagstaff mall , and seven community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 55 million square feet of gla. these 57 centers average approximately 903,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 3.5 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 185,000 square feet of gla at boulevard shops . as of december 31, 2015 , excluding flagstaff mall , the centers primarily included 204 anchors totaling approximately 27.7 million square feet of gla and approximately 5,800 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 24.3 million square feet of gla. competition: numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with the company in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants: the centers, excluding flagstaff mall , derived approximately 75% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2015 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet, and big box and anchor tenants accounted for 25% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2015 . total rents as set forth in "item 1. business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. 8 the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the centers, excluding flagstaff mall , based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2015 : tenant primary dbas number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents l brands, inc. victoria's secret, bath and body

freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company generally enters into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. however, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2015 , excluding flagstaff mall , comprises approximately 76% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. most of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 9 the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the

effect, as of such date, including any concessions, abatements and other adjustments or allowances that have been granted to the tenants. (2) centers under development and redevelopment are excluded from average base rents. as a result, the leases for broadway plaza, fashion outlets of niagara falls usa, fashion outlets of philadelphia , paradise valley mall, southpark mall and westside pavilion were excluded for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. the leases for paradise valley mall were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2013. the leases for the shops at atlas park and southridge center were excluded for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011. 10 flagstaff mall is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2015 . in addition, the leases for rotterdam square, which was sold on january 15, 2014, were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2013. on june 30, 2015, great northern mall was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. consequently, great northern mall is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2014. the leases for valley view center, which was sold by a court-appointed receiver in 2012, were excluded for the year ended december 31, 2011. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the year represents the actual rent paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months of the lease. (4) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. cost of occupancy: a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for the years ended december 31, 2015 (1) 2014 (2) 2013 (3) 2012 2011 consolidated centers: minimum rents 9.0 % 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.1 % 8.2 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % expense recoveries(4) 4.5 % 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.2 % 4.1 % 13.9 % 13.4 % 13.3 % 12.7 % 12.8 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 8.1 % 8.7 % 8.8 % 8.9 % 9.1 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(4) 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % 3.9 % 3.9 % 12.5 % 13.6 % 13.2 % 13.2 % 13.4 % _____________________________ (1) flagstaff mall is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2015 .

the period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. currently, 65% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. the leases for centers currently under development and redevelopment are excluded from this table. anchors: anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 8.5% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2015 , excluding flagstaff mall . 13 the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square

(6) barneys new york plans to close its store at scottsdale fashion square in spring 2016. (7) the company is seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. the company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding one of these two vacant anchor locations. (8) the company owns a portfolio of eight stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these eight stores, two have been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to kohl's, one has been leased to sports authority and four have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a 15 combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. supplemental tax disclosures - updates to reit rules the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (the path act ) was enacted on december 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to reit qualification and taxation, which are briefly summarized below: for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of the company's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss. for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, the act reduces this limit to 20%. for purposes of the reit asset tests, the path act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits will constitute real estate assets. however, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of the company's total assets. for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property. a 100% excise tax is imposed on redetermined trs service income, which is income of a trs attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated reit and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under section 482 of the code. for distributions made in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to the company. additional exceptions to the rules under the foreign investment in real property act ( firpta ) were introduced for non-u.s. persons that constitute qualified shareholders (within the meaning of section 897(k)(3) of the code) or qualified foreign pension funds (within the meaning of section 897(l)(2) of the code). after february 16, 2016, the firpta withholding rate under section 1445 of the code for dispositions of u.s. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%. the path act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the reit that a non-u.s. shareholder may have held to avail itself of the firpta exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market. in addition, the irs recently issued guidance delaying the imposition of withholding under fatca to the gross proceeds from a disposition of property that can produce u.s. source interest or dividends. such withholding will apply only to dispositions occurring after december 31, 2018. employees as of december 31, 2015 , the company had approximately 997 employees, of which approximately 976 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. 16 seasonality for a discussion of the extent to

90401 17 item 1a. risk factors the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites and the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona. nine centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with us for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with us in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make 18 suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have gone out of business. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; 19 the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. 20 some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems. we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. 21 inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2015 was $7.0 billion (consisting of $5.3 billion of consolidated debt, less $0.2 billion attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $1.9 billion of our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture mortgage notes and $60.0 million of our pro rata share of the pprt term loan). approximately $229.0 million of such indebtedness (at our pro rata share) matures in 2016. as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. 22 risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. two of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 24 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain of our charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit, among other purposes, our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: 23 have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law. some of the provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of our directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of our directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and cause the company to issue shares of one or more classes or series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority of our directors to create and cause the company to issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. in addition, the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two supermajority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, the maryland general corporation law permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to adopt certain charter and bylaw provisions, such as a classified board, that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. 24 federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. 25 complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges. if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us or our investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 63 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2015 concerning the company's long term debt

fixed rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 3.80% and 3.63% , respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.03% and 2.11% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1.8 billion and $0.9 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 4.13% and 4.50% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $170.5 million and $115.4 million , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.06% and 2.59% , respectively. the company has used derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2015 , the company did not have any interest rate cap or swap agreements in place. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $11.5 million per year based on $1.2 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2015 . the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 8 mortgage notes payable and note 9 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). 63risk factors 18 risk factors" of this annual report

was 15,263,799 at an average price of $78.62 . on july 15, 2016 , the company conveyed flagstaff mall , a 347,000 square foot regional shopping center in flagstaff , arizona , to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. the mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. as a result, the company recognized a gain of $5.3 million on the extinguishment of debt. on february 13, 2017 , the company announced that the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares as market conditions and the company's liquidity warrant. repurchases may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured or derivative transactions, including asr transactions, or other methods of acquiring shares and pursuant to rule 10b5-1 of the securities act of 1934, from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. the shopping center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the 6 shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet of gla are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. the company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages two regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). 7 development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). the centers: as of december 31, 2016 , the centers primarily included 48 regional shopping centers, excluding cascade mall and northgate mall , and seven community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 54 million square feet of gla. these 55 centers average approximately 929,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 3.5 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 185,000 square feet of gla at boulevard shops . as of december 31, 2016 , excluding cascade mall and northgate mall , the centers primarily included 193 anchors totaling approximately 26.5 million square feet of gla and approximately 5,400 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 25.1 million square feet of gla. competition: numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with the company in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. 8 major tenants: the centers, excluding cascade mall and northgate mall , derived approximately 76% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2016 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet, and big box and anchor tenants accounted for 24% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2016 . total rents as set forth in "item 1. business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the centers, excluding cascade mall and

mall stores and freestanding stores: mall store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company generally enters into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. however, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2016 , excluding cascade mall and northgate mall , comprises approximately 76% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. most of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 9 the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the past five years: mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet: for the years ended

occupied as of december 31 for each of the centers and gives effect to the terms of each lease in effect, as of such date, including any concessions, abatements and other adjustments or allowances that have been granted to the tenants. (2) centers under development and redevelopment are excluded from average base rents. as a result, the leases for broadway plaza, fashion outlets of philadelphia, paradise valley mall and westside pavilion are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. the leases for fashion outlets of niagara falls, usa and southpark mall are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. the leases for paradise valley mall are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2013. the leases for the shops at atlas park and southridge center are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2012. 10 the leases for cascade mall and northgate mall , which were sold on january 18, 2017 , are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2016. flagstaff mall was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on july 15, 2016 and is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2015. on june 30, 2015, great northern mall was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. consequently, great northern mall is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2014. the leases for rotterdam square, which was sold on january 15, 2014, are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2013. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the year represents the actual rent paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months of the lease. (4) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. cost of occupancy: a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for the years ended december 31, 2016 (1) 2015 (2) 2014 (3) 2013 (4) 2012 consolidated centers: minimum rents 9.4 % 9.0 % 8.7 % 8.4 % 8.1 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(5) 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.2 % 14.1 % 13.9 % 13.4 % 13.3 % 12.7 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 8.6 % 8.1 % 8.7 % 8.8 % 8.9 % percentage rents 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(5) 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.0 % 3.9 % 12.8 % 12.5 % 13.6 % 13.2 % 13.2 % _____________________________ (1) cascade mall and northgate mall were sold on january 18, 2017 and are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2016.

square foot on leases expiring during the period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. currently, 57% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. the leases for centers currently under development and redevelopment are excluded from this table. anchors: anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 7.9% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2016 , excluding cascade mall and northgate mall . 13 the following table identifies each anchor, each

(2) the company anticipates that primark will open a store at kings plaza shopping center in 2018 in a portion of the space vacated by sears. (3) the company is seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. the company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding two of these vacant anchor locations. (4) the company owns an office building and seven stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these seven stores, two have been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to kohl's, one is vacant and three have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.2 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center, which has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. 15 qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. supplemental tax disclosures - updates to reit rules the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (the path act ) was enacted on december 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to reit qualification and taxation, which are briefly summarized below: prior to the path act, no more than 25% of the value of the company's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, the act reduces this limit to 20%. for purposes of the reit asset tests, the path act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits will constitute real estate assets. however, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of the company's total assets. for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property. a 100% excise tax is imposed on redetermined trs service income, which is income of a trs attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated reit and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under section 482 of the code. for distributions made in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to the company. additional exceptions to the rules under the foreign investment in real property act ( firpta ) were introduced for non-u.s. persons that constitute qualified shareholders (within the meaning of section 897(k)(3) of the code) or qualified foreign pension funds (within the meaning of section 897(l)(2) of the code). after february 16, 2016, the firpta withholding rate under section 1445 of the code for dispositions of u.s. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%. the path act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the reit that a non-u.s. shareholder may have held to avail itself of the firpta exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market. for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2015, personal property shall be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test to the extent rent attributable to such personal property is qualifying income under the 75% income test (though any gain attributable to such personal property would still be non-qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% income tests). in addition, the irs recently issued guidance delaying the imposition of withholding under fatca to the gross proceeds from a disposition of property that can produce u.s. source interest or dividends. such withholding will apply only to dispositions occurring after december 31, 2018. employees as of december 31, 2016 , the company had approximately 851 employees, of which approximately 845 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. 16 seasonality for a discussion of the extent to which the company's business may be seasonal, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and

those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites and the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona. nine centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with us for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with us in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can 18 be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, have gone out of business or have significantly reduced the number of their retail stores. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and 19 our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. 20 some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.2 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems. we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. 21 possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks in the united states or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties. terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be reduced or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2016 was $7.6 billion (consisting of $5.0 billion of consolidated debt, less $0.2 billion attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $2.8 billion of our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture mortgage notes and $60.0 million of our pro rata share of an unconsolidated joint venture term loan). approximately $99.5 million of such indebtedness (at our pro rata share) matures in 2017 after giving effect to refinancing transactions and loan commitments that occurred after december 31, 2016 (see "item 1. business recent developments acquisitions and dispositions and financing activity"). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. 22 we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. two of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 25 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one of the other investors in our joint venture centers could materially and adversely affect the respective property or properties. pursuant to the bankruptcy code, we could be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. at a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a joint venture center has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not 23 wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain of our charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit, among other purposes, our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law. some of the provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of our directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of our directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and cause the company to issue shares of one or more classes or series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority of our directors to create and cause the company to issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. 24 in addition, the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two supermajority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, the maryland general corporation law permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to adopt certain charter and bylaw provisions, such as a classified board, that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets through the operating partnership and joint ventures. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. 25 in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax, interest and penalties for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that do not qualify for a statutory safe harbor if such assets constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges. if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for tax purposes, we would face adverse tax consequences. we intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. however, if the internal revenue service were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as an entity taxable as a partnership, the operating partnership would be taxable as a corporation. this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us. this could also result in our losing reit status, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income. this would substantially reduce the cash available to us to make distributions and the return on your investment. in addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its property, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership. such a recharacterization of an underlying entity could also threaten our ability to maintain reit status. 26 tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us or our investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. in addition, according to publicly released statements, a top legislative priority of the trump administration and the current congress may be significant reform of the code, including significant changes to taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense. there is a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of any such tax reform and the impact of any potential tax reform on our business and on the price of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2016 concerning the company's

debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2.7 billion and $1.8 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was 3.80% and 4.13% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $169.9 million and $170.5 million , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was 2.44% and 2.06% , respectively. the company has used derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2016 , the company did not have any interest rate cap or swap agreements in place. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $13.2 million per year based on $1.3 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2016 . the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 8 mortgage notes payable and note 9 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). 60risk factors 16 risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k, as well as our other

centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet of gla are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity and promotional events. 5 regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. the company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages two regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). 6 the centers: as of december 31, 2017 , the centers primarily included 48 regional shopping centers and seven community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 53 million square feet of gla. these 55 centers average approximately 929,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 3.5 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 185,000 square feet of gla at boulevard shops . as of december 31, 2017 , the centers primarily included 195 anchors totaling approximately 26.4 million square feet of gla and approximately 5,200 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 25.1 million square feet of gla. competition: numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with the company in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants: the centers derived approximately 74% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2017 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet, and big box and anchor tenants accounted for 26% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2017 . total rents as set forth in "item 1. business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the centers based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2017 : tenant primary dbas number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents l brands, inc. victoria's secret,

store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company generally enters into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. however, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2017 comprises approximately 65% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. much of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the past

the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. currently, 48% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. the leases for centers currently under development and redevelopment are excluded from this table. anchors: anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 7.9% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2017 . 12 the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such

(2) the company anticipates that burlington, jcpenney and primark will open stores at kings plaza shopping center in spring 2018. (3) nordstrom has announced plans to open a store at country club plaza in 2021. (4) the company is seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. the company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding one of these vacant anchor locations. (5) the company owns an office building and seven stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these seven stores, one has been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to kohl's, two are vacant and three have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.2 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center, which has a $20 million ten- 14 year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. supplemental material federal income tax considerations on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law h.r. 1, known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tcja ). the provisions of the tcja generally apply to taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017. significant provisions of the tcja that investors should be aware of include provisions that: (i) lower the corporate income tax rate to 21% and lower foreign investment in real property tax act withholding on certain capital gain dividends to 21%, (ii) provide noncorporate taxpayers with a deduction of up to 20% of certain income earned through partnerships and reits for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2026, (iii) limits the net operating loss deduction to 80% of taxable income, where taxable income is determined without regard to the net operating loss deduction itself, generally eliminates net operating loss carrybacks and allows unused net operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely, (iv) expand the ability of businesses to deduct the cost of certain property investments in the year in which the property is purchased, and (v) generally lower tax rates for individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2026, while limiting deductions such as miscellaneous itemized deductions and state and local tax deductions. in addition, the tcja limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a business to 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer. however, the limitation on the interest expense deduction does not apply to electing real property trades or businesses, such as any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. making the election to be treated as a real property trade or business requires the electing real property trade or business to depreciate non-residential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property over a longer period using the alternative depreciation system. the company generally will decide whether to make any available election to treat as a real property trade or business any direct or indirect investment made through an entity that it controls. stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the impact that the tcja and other legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on their investment in the company's stock. employees as of december 31, 2017 , the company had approximately 855 employees, of which approximately 850 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a

on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites and the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. 16 a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona. nine centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with us for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with us in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, have gone out of business or have significantly reduced the number of their retail stores. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total 17 amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. a property's value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted property cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property. in our estimate of cash flows, we consider factors such as trends and prospects and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income. if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives, the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans, intended holding periods and available market information. we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments. impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings. there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the charge is taken. 18 our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornadoes, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.2 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. 19 if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems. we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows. all of the properties in our portfolio are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act ( ada ). the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the united states government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. while the tenants to whom our portfolio is leased are obligated to comply with ada provisions, within their leased premises, if required changes within their leased premises involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. furthermore, we are required to comply with ada requirements within the common areas of our portfolio and we may not be able to pass on to our tenants any costs necessary to remediate any common area ada issues. as a result, we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our portfolio. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with, and we may be restricted in our ability to renovate or redevelop the properties subject to, those requirements. the resulting expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations. possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks in the united states or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties. terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be reduced or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their 20 ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2017 was $7.7 billion (consisting of $5.2 billion of consolidated debt, less $319.6 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $2.8 billion of our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture mortgage notes and $60.0 million of our pro rata share of an unconsolidated joint venture term loan). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. 21 risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. two of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 25 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. our partners in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one of the other investors in our joint venture centers could materially and adversely affect the respective property or properties. pursuant to the bankruptcy code, we could be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. at a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a joint venture center has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. 22 an ownership limit and certain of our charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit, among other purposes, our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law. some of the provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of our directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of our directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and cause the company to issue shares of one or more classes or series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority of our directors to create and cause the company to issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. in addition, the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two supermajority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. 23 the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, the maryland general corporation law permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to adopt certain charter and bylaw provisions, such as a classified board, that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets through the operating partnership and joint ventures. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax, interest and penalties for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. 24 complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that do not qualify for a statutory safe harbor if such assets constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges. if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. under recently enacted legislation, section 1031 exchanges now only apply to real property and do not apply to any related personal property transferred with the real property. as a result, any appreciated personal property that is transferred in connection with a section 1031 exchange of real property will cause gain to be recognized, and such gain is generally treated as non-qualifying income for the 95% and 75% gross income tests. any such non-qualifying income could have an adverse effect on our reit status. if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for tax purposes, we would face adverse tax consequences. we intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. however, if the internal revenue service were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as an entity taxable as a partnership, the operating partnership would be taxable as a corporation. this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us. this could also result in our losing reit status, with the consequences described above. this would substantially reduce the cash available to us to make distributions and the return on your investment. in addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its property, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership. such a recharacterization of an underlying entity could also threaten our ability to maintain reit status. tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us or our investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. 25 on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law h.r. 1, known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tcja ). the tcja makes major changes to the code, including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their stockholders. the individual and collective impact of these provisions and other provisions of the tax act on reits and their stockholders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the tcja on their investment in our shares. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2017 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including

consolidated centers' total fixed rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was 3.85% and 3.80% , respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was 2.98% and 2.47% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.7 billion . the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was 3.79% and 3.80% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was $106.3 million and $169.9 million , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was 2.86% and 2.44% , respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2017 , the company has one interest rate cap agreement in place (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $16.5 million per year based on $1.7 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2017 . 58 the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 9 mortgage notes payable and note 10 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements).risk factors 16 risk factors" of this

were primarily for legal and advisory services. the shopping center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet of gla are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of 6 decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. the company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages two regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. on a selective basis, the company's business strategy may include mixed-use densification to maximize space at the company's regional shopping centers, including by developing available land at the regional shopping centers or by demolishing underperforming department store boxes and redeveloping the land. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). the centers: as of december 31, 2018 , the centers primarily included 47 regional shopping centers and five community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 51 million square feet of gla. these 52 centers average approximately 935,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 3.5 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 185,000 square feet of gla at boulevard shops . as of december 31, 2018 , the centers primarily included 184 anchors totaling approximately 25.1 million square feet of gla and approximately 5,000 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 24.2 million square feet of gla. competition: numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are five other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with the company in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants: for the year ended december 31, 2018 , the centers derived approximately 72% of their total rents from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet and 28% of their total rents from big box and anchor tenants. total rents as set forth in "item 1. business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. 7 the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the centers based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2018 : tenant primary dbas

hollister 42 1.0 % mall stores and freestanding stores: mall store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company generally enters into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. however, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2018 comprises approximately 65% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. much of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 8 the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the past five years: mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet: for the years ended december 31, avg. base rent per sq.

the centers and gives effect to the terms of each lease in effect, as of such date, including any concessions, abatements and other adjustments or allowances that have been granted to the tenants. (2) centers under development and redevelopment are excluded from average base rents. as a result, the leases for fashion district philadelphia , paradise valley mall and one westside are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. the leases for broadway plaza are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. the leases for fashion outlets of niagara falls usa and southpark mall are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. 9 the leases for cascade mall and northgate mall , which were sold on january 18, 2017 , are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2016. flagstaff mall was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on july 15, 2016 and is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2015. on june 30, 2015, great northern mall was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2014. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the year represents the actual rent paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months of the lease. (4) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. cost of occupancy: a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for the years ended december 31, 2018 2017 2016 (1) 2015 (2) 2014 (3) consolidated centers: minimum rents 9.3 % 9.5 % 9.4 % 9.0 % 8.7 % percentage rents 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(4) 3.9 % 4.2 % 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.3 % 13.5 % 14.0 % 14.1 % 13.9 % 13.4 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 7.8 % 8.6 % 8.6 % 8.1 % 8.7 % percentage rents 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(4) 3.4 % 3.8 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.5 % 11.5 % 12.7 % 12.8 % 12.5 % 13.6 % _____________________________ (1) cascade mall and northgate mall were sold on january 18, 2017 and are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2016.

(2) nordstrom has announced plans to open a 116,000 square foot store at country club plaza in spring 2021. (3) kohl's has announced plans to close its store at green acres mall in 2019. 13 (4) the company is seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. (5) the company owns an office building and six stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these six stores, one has been leased to kohl's, three are vacant or partially vacant and two have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $25,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.0 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center, which has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. 14 qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. supplemental material united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion updates the disclosures under material united states federal income tax considerations in the prospectus dated august 10, 2017 contained in the company's registration statement on form s-3asr filed with the sec on august 10, 2017, as previously updated by the disclosures under supplemental material federal income tax considerations in its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017 filed with the sec on february 23, 2018 (collectively, the base disclosure ). due to a recent change in law, the applicable tax rate for backup withholding is 24%, rather than 28% as indicated in the base disclosure. the tax cuts and jobs act repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. therefore, notwithstanding the company's base disclosure, absent a subsequent change in law the company will not be subject to an alternative minimum tax. the internal revenue service has recently issued proposed regulations that limit the application of fatca (as defined in the base disclosure). specifically, no withholding is imposed under fatca on sales proceeds. these proposed regulations have not been finalized and may not ever be finalized, but taxpayers may rely upon the proposed regulations unless and until they are revised or repealed. employees as of december 31, 2018 , the company had approximately 718 employees, of which approximately 715 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. in addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. as a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.

of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites and the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona. nine centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with us for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are five other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with us in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the rental 16 rates that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition for tenants and shoppers from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, e-commerce, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years, a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, have gone out of business or have significantly reduced the number of their retail stores. if one of our tenants files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect amounts owed by that party prior to filing for bankruptcy. in addition, after filing for bankruptcy, a tenant may terminate any or all of its leases with us, in which event we would have a general unsecured claim against such tenant that would likely be worth less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. on october 15, 2018, sears filed for bankruptcy and announced additional store closings. as of december 31, 2018, following the closure of four stores during 2018, we had 17 sears stores totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet of gross leasable area within our portfolio and accounting for approximately 1% of our total minimum and percentage rents. in january 2019, sears closed nine additional stores. the remaining eight stores include three owned by us, three owned by our joint venture with seritage growth properties and two owned by a third-party. furthermore, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as e-commerce and other forms of pressure on their business models. if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might also terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in 17 increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. on a selective basis, our business strategy may include mixed-use densification to maximize space at our regional shopping centers, including by developing available land at our regional shopping centers or by demolishing underperforming department store boxes and redeveloping the land. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. a property's value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted property cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property. in our estimate of cash flows, we consider factors such as trends and prospects and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income. if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives, the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans, intended holding periods and available market information. we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments. impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings. there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the charge is taken. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 18 possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornadoes, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $25,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.0 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. 19 we face risks associated with and have been the target of security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems. we face risks associated with and have been the target of security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows. all of the properties in our portfolio are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act ( ada ). the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the united states government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. while the tenants to whom our portfolio is leased are obligated to comply with ada provisions, within their leased premises, if required changes within their leased premises involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. furthermore, we are required to comply with ada requirements within the common areas of our portfolio and we may not be able to pass on to our tenants any costs necessary to remediate any common area ada issues. as a result, we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our portfolio. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with, and we may be restricted in our ability to renovate or redevelop the properties subject to, those requirements. the resulting expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations. possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks in the united states or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties. terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be reduced or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. 20 any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2018 was $7.9 billion (consisting of $5.0 billion of consolidated debt, less $318.7 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $3.2 billion of our pro rata share of mortgages and other notes payable on unconsolidated joint ventures). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. 21 risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. two of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 23 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. our partners in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one of the other investors in our joint venture centers could materially and adversely affect the respective property or properties. pursuant to the bankruptcy code, we could be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. at a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a joint venture center has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. 22 an ownership limit and certain of our charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit, among other purposes, our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law. some of the provisions of our charter, bylaws and maryland law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of our directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of our directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and cause the company to issue shares of one or more classes or series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority of our directors to create and cause the company to issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. in addition, the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two supermajority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are 23 approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, the maryland general corporation law permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to adopt certain charter and bylaw provisions, such as a classified board, that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets through the operating partnership and joint ventures. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax, interest and penalties for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. 24 complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that do not qualify for a statutory safe harbor if such assets constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges. if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. under recently enacted legislation, section 1031 exchanges now only apply to real property and do not apply to any related personal property transferred with the real property. as a result, any appreciated personal property that is transferred in connection with a section 1031 exchange of real property will cause gain to be recognized, and such gain is generally treated as non-qualifying income for the 95% and 75% gross income tests. any such non-qualifying income could have an adverse effect on our reit status. if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for tax purposes, we would face adverse tax consequences. we intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. however, if the internal revenue service were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as an entity taxable as a partnership, the operating partnership would be taxable as a corporation. this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us. this could also result in our losing reit status, with the consequences described above. this would substantially reduce the cash available to us to make distributions and the return on your investment. in addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its property, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership. such a recharacterization of an underlying entity could also threaten our ability to maintain reit status. 25 recent legislation substantially modified the taxation of reits and their shareholders, and the effects of such legislation and related regulatory action are uncertain. on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law h.r. 1, informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act (the tcja ). the tcja makes major changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code ), including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their stockholders. among the changes made by the tcja are permanently reducing the generally applicable corporate tax rate, generally reducing the tax rate applicable to individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026, eliminating or modifying certain previously allowed deductions (including substantially limiting interest deductibility and, for individuals, the deduction for non-business state and local taxes), and, for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026, providing for preferential rates of taxation through a deduction of up to 20% (subject to certain limitations) on most ordinary reit dividends and certain trade or business income of non-corporate taxpayers. the tcja also imposes new limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and requires us to recognize income for tax purposes no later than when we take it into account on our financial statements, which may result in us having to make additional taxable distributions to our stockholders in order to comply with reit distribution requirements or avoid taxes on retained income and gains. the effect of the significant changes made by the tcja is highly uncertain, and administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions. the effect of any technical corrections with respect to the tcja could have an adverse effect on us or our stockholders. investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the tcja on their investment in our capital stock. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets

december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.5 billion . the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was 4.00% and 2.98% , respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion , respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31,

$106.3 million , respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was 4.13% and 2.86% , respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2018 , the company has one interest rate cap agreement and four interest rate swap agreements in place (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). 57 in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $17.6 million per year based on $1.8 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2018 . the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 9 mortgage notes payable and note 10 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements).risk factors 16 risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k, as well as our other reports

several years. the estimated range of redevelopment costs could increase if the company or its joint venture decides to expand the scope of the redevelopments. the company has funded $22.4 million at its pro rata share as of december 31, 2019. other transactions and events: on january 1, 2019, the company adopted accounting standards codification ("asc") 842, "leases", under the modified retrospective method. the new standard amended the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). in connection with the adoption of the new lease standard, the company elected to use the transition packages of practical expedients for implementation provided by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), which included (i) relief from re-assessing whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease, (ii) relief from re-assessing the classification of expired or existing leases at the adoption date, (iii) allowing previously capitalized initial direct leasing costs to continue to be amortized, and (iv) application of the standard as of the adoption date rather than to all periods presented. upon adoption of the new standard, the company has presented all revenues associated with leases as leasing revenue on its consolidated statements of operations. the new standard requires the company to reduce leasing revenue for credit losses associated with lease receivables. in addition, straight-line rent receivables are written off when the company believes there is reasonable uncertainty regarding a tenant's ability to complete the term of the lease. the new standard also requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in negotiating a lease. initial direct costs include the salaries and related costs for employees directly working on leasing activities. prior to january 1, 2019, these costs were capitalizable and therefore the new lease standard resulted in certain of these costs being expensed as incurred. the shopping center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla ("outlet centers"). in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the 5 shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet of gla are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with, and be responsive to, the needs of retailers. the company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages one regional shopping center and two community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. 6 redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. on a selective basis, the company's business strategy may include mixed-use densification to maximize space at the company's regional shopping centers, including by developing available land at the regional shopping centers or by demolishing underperforming department store boxes and redeveloping the land. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (see "redevelopment and development activity" in recent developments). the centers: as of december 31, 2019, the centers primarily included 47 regional shopping centers and five community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 51 million square feet of gla. these 52 centers average approximately 920,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 3.5 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 184,000 square feet of gla at boulevard shops. as of december 31, 2019, the centers primarily includ ed 176 anchors totaling approximately 23.7 million square feet of gla and approximately 5,000 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 24.5 million square feet of gla. competition: numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are a number of other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with the company in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. 7 major tenants: for the year ended december 31, 2019, the centers derived approximately 73% of their total rents from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet and 27% of their total rents from big box and anchor tenants. total rents as set forth in "item 1. business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the centers based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2019: tenant primary dbas number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents l

september 2019. the total rents used to compute the percentage of rent paid by forever 21, inc. in the table above are the anticipated rents to be paid to the company in 2020 based on a negotiated settlement currently in process through the bankruptcy court. mall stores and freestanding stores: mall store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. the company generally enters into leases for mall stores and freestanding stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. however, certain leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2019 comprises approximately 65% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. much of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 8 the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the past five years: mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet: for the years ended

_____________________ (1) average base rent per square foot is based on spaces occupied as of december 31 for each of the centers and gives effect to the terms of each lease in effect, as of such date, including any concessions, abatements and other adjustments or allowances that have been granted to the tenants. (2) centers under development and redevelopment are excluded from average base rents. as a result, the leases for fashion district philadelphia, paradise valley mall and one westside are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. the leases for broadway plaza are excluded for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. the leases for fashion outlets of niagara falls usa and southpark mall are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2015. 9 the leases for cascade mall and northgate mall, which were sold on january 18, 2017, are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2016. flagstaff mall was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on july 15, 2016 and is excluded for the year ended december 31, 2015. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the year represents the actual rent paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months of the lease. (4) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. cost of occupancy: a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for the years ended december 31, 2019 2018 2017 2016(1) 2015(2) consolidated centers: minimum rents 9.1 % 9.3 % 9.5 % 9.4 % 9.0 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(3) 3.6 % 3.9 % 4.2 % 4.3 % 4.5 % 13.1 % 13.5 % 14.0 % 14.1 % 13.9 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 7.3 % 7.8 % 8.6 % 8.6 % 8.1 % percentage rents 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(3) 3.2 % 3.4 % 3.8 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 10.8 % 11.5 % 12.7 % 12.8 % 12.5 % _____________________________ (1) cascade mall and northgate mall were sold on january 18, 2017 and are excluded for the year ended december 31, 2016.

(3) nordstrom has announced plans to open a 116,000 square foot store at country club plaza in 2021. (4) forever 21 has announced plans to close two of these stores in early 2020 at arrowhead towne center and danbury fair mall. the company is actively seeking replacement tenants for these company-owned sites. 13 (5) the lord &amp; taylor store closed at tysons corner center in january 2020. the joint venture is actively evaluating redevelopment opportunities. (6) primark has announced plans to open a 47,000 square foot store at fashion district philadelphia in spring 2021. (7) the company is actively seeking replacement tenants or has entered into replacement leases for many of these vacant sites and/or is currently executing on or considering redevelopment opportunities for these locations. the company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding one of these vacant anchors. (8) the company owns an office building and six stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these six stores, one has been leased to kohl's, two are vacant and three have been leased for non-anchor usage. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $25,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.0 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center, which has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. 14 qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. supplemental material united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion updates the disclosures under material united states federal income tax considerations in the prospectus dated august 10, 2017 contained in the company's registration statement on form s-3 filed with the sec on august 10, 2017, as previously updated by the disclosures under supplemental material federal income tax considerations in its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017 filed with the sec on february 23, 2018 and its annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 filed with the sec on february 25, 2019 (collectively, the base disclosure ). the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tcja") repealed the rule, referenced under the heading taxable reit subsidiaries, that limits a taxable reit subsidiary's ability to deduct interest payments made to the company. the tcja introduced a rule which may limit the deductibility of interest payments by the company and its subsidiaries, including its taxable reit subsidiaries. however, certain tax elections may be available to a "real property trade or business" to have this rule not apply. recently promulgated proposed regulations make certain changes to the discussion of qualified foreign pension funds appearing under the heading taxation of non-u.s. stockholders dispositions of stock . under the proposed regulations, entities that are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more qualified foreign pension funds are exempt from firpta in the same manner as described in the base disclosure for qualified foreign pension funds. the proposed regulations also do not require an entity to provide annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to relevant local tax authorities in order to qualify as a qualified foreign pension fund as long as such information is either available to the taxing authorities or is provided to another government agency. these proposed regulations have not been finalized, may never be finalized, and may be rescinded at any time, but taxpayers may rely on them while they are proposed, provided they apply them consistently and accurately. the tcja introduced a rule which expanded the scope of the $1 million limitation on corporate tax deductions and repealed the exclusion for performance-based compensation (the "section 162(m) limitation"). proposed regulations were issued in late 2019 which may cause the company to be subject to the section 162(m) limitation. employees as of december 31, 2019, the company had approximately 737 employees, of which approximately 723 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. in addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. as a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter. sustainability a recognized leader in sustainability, the company has achieved the #1 global real estate sustainability benchmark (gresb) ranking in the north american retail sector for five straight years 2015 2019. additional information about the company's

differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. for purposes of this risk factor section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as wholly owned centers and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as joint venture centers. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites and the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and 16 increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona. nine centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with us for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or anchors to occupy space. there are a number of other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the united states, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an anchor or a tenant. in addition, these companies, as well as other reits, private real estate companies or investors compete with us in terms of property acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the rental rates that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition for tenants and shoppers from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, e-commerce, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years, a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, have gone out of business, have significantly reduced their brick-and-mortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others. if one of our tenants files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect amounts owed by that party prior to filing for bankruptcy. we may make lease modifications either pre- or post-bankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern. in addition, after filing for bankruptcy, a tenant may terminate any or all of its leases with us, in which event we would have a general unsecured claim against such tenant that would likely be worth less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term. furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in re-letting the space vacated by a bankrupt tenant and may not be able to release the space on similar terms or at all. the bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor, may require a substantial redevelopment of their space, the success of which cannot be assured, and may make the re-letting of their space difficult and costly, and it may also be difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property. on october 15, 2018, sears filed for bankruptcy and announced additional store closings. at the time of the bankruptcy filing, we had 21 sears stores in our portfolio totaling approximately 3.1 million square feet and accounting for less than 1% of the company's total leasing revenue. as of december 31, 2019, we recaptured ten sears locations, including seven through our joint venture with seritage growth properties ("seritage"), through formal lease rejections and lease terminations. we anticipate aggregate redevelopment investments at several of these locations of $130.0 million to $160.0 million (at our pro rata share) over the next several years. new tenants are expected to open at several projects in 2020. in early 2020, sears will be closing five additional locations, including three stores in which we have an ownership interest and two that are owned by 17 seritage and not by us. sears will continue to pay rent on these locations in which we have an ownership interest. we are actively seeking replacement tenants for these company-owned sites. although, in the short-term, the bankruptcy of an anchor such as sears may lead to lost base rent and the triggering of co-tenancy clauses, there is also the potential to create additional future value through the recapturing of space and releasing that space to new tenants at higher rents per square foot, which we have demonstrated through our joint venture with seritage and the completed redevelopment of a former sears store at kings plaza shopping center in july 2018. on september 29, 2019, forever 21, inc. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. at the time of the bankruptcy filing, we had 29 forever 21 stores in our portfolio totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet. as of december 31, 2019, forever 21 stores represented 1.4% of our total minimum and percentage rental revenues. we are in ongoing discussions with forever 21 regarding the status of these stores. based on a court filing dated october 28, 2019, we expect that four of the forever 21 stores will close, three of which are owned by us, and one of which is not owned by us. we anticipate that we may provide certain rent concessions in connection with a number of the remaining stores. we are actively seeking replacement tenants for these company-owned sites. furthermore, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as e-commerce and other forms of pressure on their business models. if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might also terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. on a selective basis, our business strategy may include mixed-use densification to maximize space at our regional shopping centers, including by developing available land at our regional shopping centers or by demolishing underperforming department store boxes and redeveloping the land. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be 18 sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. additionally, if we elect to pursue a "mixed-use" redevelopment, we expose ourselves to risks associated with each non-retail use (e.g., office, residential, hotel and entertainment). if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. excess space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us. certain of our properties have had excess space available for prospective tenants, and those properties may continue to experience, and other properties may commence experiencing, such oversupply in the future. among other causes, (1) there has been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchors and other national retailers, as well as store closures, and (2) there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space, due to certain retailers increasing their use of e-commerce websites to distribute their merchandise. as a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants, there is a downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect us. real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. we periodically assess whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. a property's value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted and unleveraged property cash flows, taking into account the anticipated probability weighted average holding period, are less than the carrying value of the property. in our estimate of cash flows, we consider trends and prospects for a property and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income. if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives, the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans, intended holding periods and available market information. we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments. impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings. there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the charge is recognized. our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards 19 properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ( acms ) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornadoes, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $100 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $25,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1.0 billion. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 retention and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another center has a $20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we face risks associated with and have been the target of security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems. we face risks associated with and have been the target of security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of 20 proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows. all of the properties in our portfolio are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act ( ada ). the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the united states government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. while the tenants to whom our portfolio is leased are obligated to comply with ada provisions, within their leased premises, if required changes within their leased premises involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. furthermore, we are required to comply with ada requirements within the common areas of the properties in our portfolio and we may not be able to pass on to our tenants any costs necessary to remediate any common area ada issues. as a result, we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our portfolio. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with, and we may be restricted in our ability to renovate or redevelop the properties subject to, those requirements. the resulting expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations. possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks in the united states or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties. terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss, and the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be reduced or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. to the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. these acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. inflation also poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates. such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as result in higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. in certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. however, in an increasing 21 interest rate environment the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2019 was $8.1 billion (consisting of $5.2 billion of consolidated debt, less $359.1 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus $3.2 billion of our pro rata share of mortgages and other notes payable on unconsolidated joint ventures). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. in addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. we may be adversely affected by the potential discontinuation of libor. in july 2017, the financial conduct authority (the fca ) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. as a result, the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee which identified the secured overnight financing rate ( sofr ) as its preferred alternative to usd-libor. we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be published or precisely how sofr will be calculated and published. any changes adopted by the fca or other governing bodies in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor. if that were to occur, our interest payments could change. in addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if libor were to remain available in its current form. we have contracts that are indexed to libor and are monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest amounts on our variable rate debt, the variable rate debt of our joint ventures and the swap rate for our interest rate swaps. in the event that libor is discontinued, the interest rates will be based on an alternative variable rate specified in the applicable documentation governing such debt or swaps or as otherwise agreed upon. such an event would not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or swaps, but the alternative variable rate could be higher and more volatile than libor prior to its discontinuance. certain risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative variable rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. the value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to libor could also be impacted if libor is limited or discontinued. for some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require substantial negotiation with each respective counterparty. 22 if a contract is not transitioned to an alternative variable rate and libor is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract. if libor is discontinued or if the method of calculating libor changes from its current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that libor will become unavailable prior to that point. this could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator. in that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative variable rate will be accelerated and magnified. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our operating partnership or any of its partners, on the other. our directors and officers have duties to our company under maryland law in connection with their management of our company. at the same time, we have duties and obligations to our operating partnership and its limited partners under delaware law as modified by the partnership agreement of our operating partnership in connection with the management of our operating partnership as the sole general partner. our duties and obligations as the general partner of our operating partnership may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partners hips that own 23 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional propert ies through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. our partners in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one of the other investors in our joint venture centers could materially and adversely affect the respective property or properties. pursuant to the bankruptcy code, we could be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. at a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a joint venture center has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. 23 our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain of our charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership l i mit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, (the "code") to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals ) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit, among other purposes, our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the ownership limit ) of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of our directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of our directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and cause the company to issue shares of one or more classes or series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority of our directors to create and cause the company to issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit a change in control or reduce the value of our common stock. certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law (the mgcl ) may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares, including: 24 business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter may impose special appraisal rights and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares ) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. as permitted by the mgcl, our charter exempts from the business combination provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. the mgcl also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. additionally, pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have opted out of the control share acquisition provisions of the mgcl. however, in the future, we may, without the approval of our stockholders, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl. the mgcl and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. furthermore, our board of directors has adopted a resolution prohibiting us from electing to be subject to the provisions of title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl that would, among other things, permit our board of directors to classify the board without stockholder approval. such provisions of title 3, subtitle 8 of the mgcl could have an anti-takeover effect. we may only elect to be subject to the classified board provisions of title 3, subtitle 8 after first obtaining the approval of our stockholders. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets through the operating partnership and joint ventures. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. 25 in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods. such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax, interest and penalties for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the code impose a 100% tax on income from prohibited transactions. prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that do not qualify for a statutory safe harbor if such assets constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges. if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. section 1031 exchanges now only apply to real property and do not apply to any related personal property transferred with the real property. as a result, any appreciated personal property that is transferred in connection with a section 1031 exchange of real property will cause gain to be recognized, and such gain is generally treated as non-qualifying income for the 95% and 75% gross income tests. any such non-qualifying income could have an adverse effect on our reit status. if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for tax purposes, we would face adverse tax consequences. we intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. however, if the internal revenue service were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as an entity taxable as a partnership, the operating partnership would be taxable as a corporation. this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us. this could also result in our losing reit status, with the consequences described above. this would substantially reduce the cash available to us to make distributions and the return on your investment. in addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its property, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax 26 purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership. such a recharacterization of an underlying entity could also threaten our ability to maintain reit status. the tcja substantially modified the taxation of reits and their shareholders, and the effects of such legislation and related regulatory action are uncertain. the tcja makes major changes to the code, including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their stockholders. among the changes made by the tcja are permanently reducing the generally applicable corporate tax rate, generally reducing the tax rate applicable to individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026, eliminating or modifying certain previously allowed deductions (including substantially limiting interest deductibility and, for individuals, the deduction for non-business state and local taxes), and, for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026, providing for preferential rates of taxation through a deduction of up to 20% (subject to certain limitations) on most ordinary reit dividends and certain trade or business income of non-corporate taxpayers. the tcja also imposes new limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and requires us to recognize income for tax purposes no later than when we take it into account on our financial statements, which may result in us having to make additional taxable distributions to our stockholders in order to comply with reit distribution requirements or avoid taxes on retained income and gains. the effect of the significant changes made by the tcja is highly uncertain, and administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions. the effect of any technical corrections with respect to the tcja could have an adverse effect on us or our stockholders. investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the tcja on their investment in our capital stock. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as

1,756,583 $ 3,235,987 $ 3,258,508 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) fixed rate debt includes $400 million of floating rate bank and other notes payable. the company has four interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a total of $400 million of the outstanding balance from floating rate debt of libor plus 1.55% to fixed rate debt of 4.30% until september 30, 2021 (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements ). the consolidated centers' total fixed rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was 3.99% and 3.87%, respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was 3.36% and 3.94%, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.0 billion. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was 3.81% and 3.83%, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was $196.1 million and $221.4 million, respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was 3.69% and 4.13%, respectively. 56 the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2019, the company has one interest rate cap agreement and four interest rate swap agreements in place (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $10.5 million per year based on $1.0 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2019. the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 10 mortgage notes payable and note 11 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). in the event that libor is discontinued, the interest rate for the variable rate debt of the company and its joint ventures and the swap rate for the company's interest rate swaps following such event will be based on an alternative variable rate as specified in the applicable documentation governing such debt or swaps or as otherwise agreed upon. such an event would not affect the company's ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or swaps, but the alternative variable rate could be higher and more volatile than libor prior to its discontinuance. the company understands that libor is expected to remain available through the end of 2021, but may be discontinued or otherwise become unavailable thereafter.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk

interest rate decreased from 2.61% in 2002 to 1.88% in 2003. the macerich company 57 see "item 2 mortgage debt" for additional information on new financing arrangements during 2003. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. the company requires that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. for derivative instruments associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. any instrument that meets these hedging criteria is formally designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified resulting in some ineffectiveness, the portion of the change in the derivative fair value related to ineffectiveness from period to period will be included in net income. if any derivative instrument used for risk management does not meet the hedging criteria then it is marked-to-market each period, however, the company intends for all derivative transactions to meet all the hedge criteria and qualify as hedges. on an ongoing quarterly basis, the company adjusts its balance sheet to reflect the current fair value of its derivatives. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in income or comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction, and on the type of hedge transaction. to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in income. over time, the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income. this reclassification occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in income. the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. to determine the fair value of derivative instruments, the company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination cost at each balance sheet date. all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. the $250.0 million variable rate debt maturing in 2007 has an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at 4.45% from november 2003 to october 13, 2005. the fair value of this swap agreement at december 31, 2003 was $228. the company has an interest rate cap with a notional amount of $92,000 on their $108,000 loan on the oaks. this interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 7.10%. this cap agreement terminates july 1, 2004. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2003 was zero. the company's east mesa land and superstition springs joint venture have an interest rate swap which converts $12,845 of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% to a fixed rate of 5.39%. this swap has been designated as a hedge in accordance with sfas no. 133. additionally, interest rate caps were simultaneously sold to offset the effect of the interest rate cap agreements. these interest rate caps do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas 133. 58 the macerich company in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $10.1 million per year based on $1.0 billion outstanding of variable rate debt, excluding the $250.0 million of debt maturing in 2007, at december 31, 2003. the fair value of the company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate

financing arrangements during 2004. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. the company requires that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. for derivative instruments associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. any instrument that meets these hedging criteria, and other criteria required by sfas 133, is formally designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified resulting in some ineffectiveness, the portion of the change in the derivative fair value related to ineffectiveness from period to period will be included in net income. if any derivative instrument used for the macerich company 61 risk management does not meet the hedging criteria then it is marked-to-market each period, however, generally the company intends for all derivative transactions to meet all the hedge criteria and qualify as hedges. the company does not plan to enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. on an ongoing quarterly basis, the company adjusts its balance sheet to reflect the current fair value of its derivatives. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in income or comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction. for derivatives that do not meet the cash flow hedging criteria, the company reflects those on the balance sheet quarterly at fair value with the difference being reflected in income. to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in income. over time, the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income. this reclassification occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in income. the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. to determine the fair value of derivative instruments, the company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination cost at each balance sheet date. all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. the $250.0 million variable rate debt maturing in 2007 has an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at 4.45% from november 2003 to october 13, 2005. the fair value of this swap agreement at december 31, 2004 was $1.9 million compared to $0.2 million at december 31, 2003. the company has an interest rate cap with a notional amount of $30.0 million on their loan at la cumbre plaza. this interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 7.12%. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2004 was zero. the company has an interest rate cap with a notional amount of $92.0 million on their $108.0 million loan on the oaks. this interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 7.10%. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2004 and 2003 was zero. the company's east mesa land and superstition springs joint venture have an interest rate swap which converts $12.8 million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% to a fixed rate of 5.39%. this swap has been designated as a hedge in accordance with sfas no. 133. additionally, interest rate caps were simultaneously sold to offset the effect of the interest rate cap agreements. these interest rate caps do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas 133. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $13.9 million per year based on $1.4 billion outstanding of variable rate debt at december 31, 2004 which excludes the $250.0 million of debt which has been swapped to a fixed rate. 62 the macerich company the fair value of the company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskrisk factors we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws, and by interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing. in addition, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we were to sell one or more of our centers, we may receive less money than we originally invested in the center. some of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona and 12 centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factor, or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. our centers must compete with other retail centers and retail formats for tenants and customers. there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the centers in attracting tenants to lease space, and an increasing number of new retail formats and technologies other than retail shopping centers compete with the centers for retail sales. competing retail formats include lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, power the macerich company 15 centers, discount shopping clubs, mail-order services, internet shopping and home shopping networks. our revenues may be reduced as a result of increased competition. our centers depend on tenants to generate rental revenues. our revenues and funds available for distribution will be reduced if: a significant number of our tenants are unable (due to poor operating results, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations; we are unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms; or for any other reason, we are unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. a decision by an anchor, or other significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other anchors and/or other tenants to terminate their leases, seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. the bankruptcy and /or closure of retail stores, or sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer, may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers decline sufficiently, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. for example, on october 24, 2005, federated department stores, inc. disclosed that it has identified 82 duplicate locations in certain malls which will be divested during 2006. eleven of the identified stores are located in 10 of our centers. on february 1, 2006, musicland holding corp. announced the closure of 341 of its low performing sam goody and suncoast picture stores which include 26 stores located in the centers. retail brand alliance has recently closed 26 of its casual corner, petite sophisticate and august max stores located in the centers. no assurances can be given regarding the impact on us of those divestitures or closures if or when they occur. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private 16 the macerich company real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. u.s. federal income tax developments could affect the desirability of investing in us for individual taxpayers. in may 2003, u.s. federal legislation was enacted that reduced the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to individual taxpayers generally from 38.6% to 15% (from january 1, 2003 through 2008). however, dividends payable by reits are not eligible for such treatment, except in limited circumstances which we do not expect to occur. although this legislation did not have a directly adverse effect on the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits, the more favorable treatment for non-reit dividends could cause individual investors to consider investments in non-reit corporations as more attractive relative to an investment in a reit. certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. each of the principals serve as our executive officers and are members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers may create conflicts of interest. the macerich company 17 the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. the guarantees of indebtedness by and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals have guaranteed mortgage loans encumbering one of the centers. as of december 31, 2005, the principals have guaranteed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $21.8 million. the existence of guarantees of these loans by the principals could result in the principals having interests that are inconsistent with the interests of our stockholders. the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. 18 the macerich company even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, sell a portion of our investments (potentially at disadvantageous prices) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts for investments. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 44 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in centers that are not wholly owned centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as the macerich company 19 well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. our holding company structure makes it dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of acms into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and 20 the macerich company redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $10,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million for both certified and non-certified acts of terrorism. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $10 million three-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on many of the centers for less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, the entity that owns the affected center could lose its capital invested in the center, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the center, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the center. an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact our financial condition. as the general partner of the operating partnership and certain of the property partnerships, we are generally liable for any of its unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control of us or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all four principals). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of common stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. the macerich company 21 our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. stockholder rights plan and selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. agreements to which we are a party, as well as some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these agreements and provisions include the following: a stockholder rights plan (which is generally triggered when an entity, group or person acquires 15% or more of our common stock), which, in the event of a takeover attempt not approved by our board of directors, allows our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock, or the common stock of the acquiring entity, at a 50% discount; a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors, which may make the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult; advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's shares) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested 22 the macerich company stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. risk factors," among others. the company will not update any forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information. management's overview and summary the macerich company (the "company") is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management, and leasing of regional and community shopping centers located throughout the united states. the company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, the macerich partnership, l.p., a delaware limited partnership (the "operating partnership"). as of december 31, 2005, the operating partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 75 regional shopping centers, 20 community

connecticut, new york, new jersey, kentucky and virginia. the total purchase price was approximately $2.333 billion, plus adjustments for working capital, including the assumption of approximately

wilmorite centers." the mall of victor valley, la cumbre plaza, fiesta mall, paradise village ground leases, village center, village crossroads, village fair and paradise village office park ii are referred to herein as the "2004 acquisition centers." biltmore fashion park, inland center, kierland commons, metrocenter, northpark center, ridgmar mall and tysons center are joint ventures and these properties are reflected using the equity method of accounting. the company's share of the results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the company in the income statement line item entitled "equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures." many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred due to the transactions described above including the acquisition of the 2005 wilmorite centers and the 2004 acquisition centers. kierland commons, metrocenter, ridgmar mall and tysons center are referred to herein as the "2005 joint venture acquisition centers." biltmore fashion park, inland center and northpark center are referred to herein as the "2004 joint venture acquisition centers." 29 th street, parklane mall, santa monica place and queens center were under redevelopment during all or a portion of the reporting periods and are referred to herein as the "redevelopment centers." la encantada and scottsdale 101 were under development during all or a portion of the reporting periods and are referred to herein as the "development properties." all other centers, excluding the redevelopment centers, the development properties, the 2005 wilmorite centers, the 2004 acquisition centers, the 2005 joint venture acquisition centers and the 2004 acquisition centers, are referred to herein as the "same centers," unless the context otherwise requires. inflation in the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate. most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease the macerich company 43 term. these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index ("cpi"). in addition, about 6%-13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. additionally, historically the majority of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. in january 2005, the company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center. this change shifts the burden of cost control to the company. seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. in addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission ("sec") defines "critical accounting policies" as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. the company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. however, the following policies are deemed to be critical. revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight lining of rent adjustment." currently, 37% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. 44 the macerich company property costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. interest incurred or imputed on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes hvac equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc. are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings and improvements 5-40 years tenant improvements initial term of related lease equipment and furnishings 5-7 years accounting for acquisitions the company accounts for all acquisitions entered into subsequent to june 30, 2001 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 141, "business combinations." the company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. the company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. the balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) origination value, which represents the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in our markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. origination value is recorded as an other asset and is amortized over the remaining lease terms. value of in-place leases is recorded as another asset and amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. above or below market leases are classified as an other asset or liability, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases. when the company acquires real estate properties, the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties. the macerich company 45 generally, the company engages a valuation firm to assist with the allocation. asset impairment the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenant's ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center. deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. in-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal. leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. the range of the terms of the agreements are as follows: deferred lease costs 1-15 years deferred financing costs 1-15 years in-place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs 5-10 years comparison of years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004 revenues minimum and percentage rents increased by 40.4% to $487.5 million in 2005 from $347.3 million in 2004. approximately $92.9 million of the increase relates to the 2005 wilmorite centers, $1.6

acquisition centers which is offset by decreases resulting from the company structuring the majority of its new leases using an annual multiple of cpi increases, which generally do not require straight-lining treatment. the amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in minimum rents, increased to $11.6 million in 2005 from $9.2 million in 2004. the increase is primarily due to the 2005 wilmorite centers and the 2004 acquisition centers. tenant recoveries increased to $229.5 million in 2005 from $159.0 million in 2004. approximately $52.9 million of the increase relates to the 2005 wilmorite centers, $5.3 million relates to queens center 46 the macerich company and the development properties, $9.2 million relates to the 2004 acquisition centers and $3.1 million relates to the same centers. management companies' revenues increased by 21.4% to $26.1 million in 2005 from $21.5 million in 2004 primarily due to increased management fees received from the 2005 and 2004 joint venture acquisition centers and third party management contracts. shopping center and operating expenses shopping center and operating expenses increased to $243.8 million in 2005 compared to $164.5 million in 2004. this increase is a result of $54.9 million of expenses from the 2005 wilmorite centers, $10.5 million from the 2004 acquisition centers, $5.5 million from queens center and the development properties and $2.0 million from increased operating and ground rent expenses at the same centers. in addition, there was a write-off of a contingent compensation liability of $6.4 million in 2004. management companies' operating expenses management companies' operating expenses increased by 19.7% to $52.8 million in 2005 from $44.1 million in 2004, primarily due to higher compensation expense in 2005 compared to 2004. reit general and administrative expenses reit general and administrative expenses increased to $12.1 million in 2005 from $11.1 million in 2004, primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expense compared to 2004. depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to $206.1 million in 2005 from $142.1 million in 2004. approximately $60.6 million relates to the 2005 wilmorite centers, $3.0 million relates to the 2004 acquisition centers and $3.6 million relates to queens center and the development properties. this is offset by a $3.2 million decrease relating to the same centers. interest expense interest expense increased to $249.9 million in 2005 from $146.3 million in 2004. approximately $26.6 million relates to the assumed debt from the 2005 wilmorite centers, $39.8 million relates to the term and acquisition loans for the wilmorite acquisition, $19.8 million relates to increased

centers, $10.6 million relates to queens center and the development properties and $4.5 million relates to an increase in interest rates on floating rate debt at the same centers. these increases are offset in part by a $4.6 million decrease related to the payoff of the $250 million term loan on july 30, 2004. additionally, capitalized interest was $10.0 million in 2005, down from $8.9 million in 2004. minority interest the minority interest represents the 19.0% weighted average interest of the operating partnership not owned by the company during 2005. this compares to 19.5% not owned by the

activities cash used in investing activities was $131.9 million in 2005 compared to $489.8 million in 2004. the change resulted primarily from increases in distributions of capital from unconsolidated

rents, increased to $9.2 million in 2004 from $6.1 million in 2003. the increase is primarily due to the 2003 acquisition center, 2004 acquisition centers and the company acquiring 50% of its joint venture partner's interest in flatiron crossing. the amount of straight-lined rents, included in minimum rent, was $1.0 million in 2004 as compared to $2.9 million in 2003. the decrease is due to the

expenditures (in millions) incurred at the centers for the years ending december 31: consolidated centers: 2005 2004 2003 acquisitions of property and equipment $1,767.2 $301.1 $359.2 development, redevelopment and expansion of centers 77.2 139.3 166.3 renovations of centers 51.1 21.2 21.7 tenant allowances 21.8 10.9 7.3 deferred leasing charges 21.8 16.8 15.2 total $1,939.1 $489.3 $569.7 joint venture centers (at company's pro rata share): acquisitions of property and equipment(1) $736.4 $41.1 $(19.2) development, redevelopment and expansion of centers 79.4 6.6 17.6 renovations of centers 32.2 10.1 2.8 tenant allowances 8.9 10.5 4.7 deferred leasing charges 5.1 3.7 3.3 total $862.0 $72.0 $9.2 (1) includes the company's purchase of its joint venture partner's 50% interest in flatiron crossing on january 31, 2003. management expects similar levels to be incurred in future years for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges and to incur between $250 million to $350 million in 2006 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. capital for major expenditures or major developments and redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which include borrowings under the company's line of credit and construction loans. however, many factors impact the company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. the company believes that it will have access to the capital necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for growth and maximizing ffo. the company presently intends to obtain additional capital necessary for these purposes through a combination of debt or equity financings, joint ventures and the sale of non-core assets. the company believes joint venture arrangements have in the past and may in the future provide an attractive alternative to other forms of financing, whether for acquisitions or other business opportunities. the company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2005 was $6.9 billion (including $1.5 billion of its pro rata share of joint venture debt). this equated to a debt to total market capitalization (defined as total debt of the company, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of op units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 56.0% at december 31, 2005. the majority of the company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties. the macerich company 53 the company filed a shelf registration statement, effective june 6, 2002, to sell securities. the shelf registration was for a total of $1.0 billion of common stock, common stock warrant or common stock rights. the company sold a total of 15.2 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration on november 27, 2002. the aggregate offering price of this transaction was approximately $440.2 million, leaving approximately $559.8 million available under the shelf registration statement. in addition, the company filed another shelf registration statement, effective october 27, 2003, to sell up to $300 million of preferred stock. on january 12, 2006, the company filed a shelf registration statement registering an unspecified amount of common stock as may from time to time be offered. on january 19, 2006, the company issued 10.9 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $747.0 million. the net proceeds were used to pay off the $619.0 million acquisition loan (see note 15 of the company's notes to consolidated financial statements) and to pay down the line of credit pending use to pay part of the purchase price for valley river center (see recent developments acquisitions). the company had a $425.0 million revolving line of credit. this revolving line of credit had a three-year term through july 26, 2005 with a one-year extension option. the interest rate fluctuated from libor plus 1.75% to libor plus 3.00% depending on the company's overall leverage level. on july 30, 2004, the company amended and expanded the revolving line of credit to $1.0 billion and extended the maturity to july 30, 2007 plus a one-year extension. in april 2005, the interest rate on the facility was reduced to 1.50% over libor based on the company's current leverage level. the interest rate fluctuates from libor plus 1.15% to libor plus 1.70% depending on the company's overall leverage level. as of december 31, 2005, $863.0 million of borrowings were outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.93%. on may 13, 2003, the company issued $250.0 million in unsecured notes maturing in may 2007 with a one-year extension option bearing interest at libor plus 2.50%. the proceeds were used to pay down and create more availability under the company's line of credit. at december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004, the entire $250.0 million of notes were outstanding at an interest rate of 6.0% and 4.45%, respectively. the company had an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at 4.45% from november 2003 to october 13, 2005. concurrently with the wilmorite closing, the company modified these unsecured notes. the interest rate was reduced to libor plus 1.50%. at december 31, 2005, the company had cash and cash equivalents available of $155.1 million. off-balance sheet arrangements the company has an ownership interest in a number of joint ventures as detailed in note 3 to the company's consolidated financial statements included herein. the company accounts for those investments using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the company as "investments in unconsolidated joint ventures." a pro rata share of the mortgage debt on these properties is shown in item 2. properties mortgage debt. in addition, certain joint ventures also have debt that could become recourse debt to the company or its subsidiaries, in excess of it's pro rata share, should the joint ventures be unable to discharge the obligations 54 the macerich company of the related debt. the following reflects the maximum amount of debt principal that could recourse to the company at december 31, 2005 (in thousands): property name recourse debt maturity date boulevard shops $4,280 12/16/2007 chandler village center 16,624 12/19/2006 metrocenter 726 2/9/2008 $21,630 the above amounts decreased $2.5 million from december 31, 2004. additionally, as of december 31, 2005, the company is contingently liable for $5.6 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the company of certain obligations relating to the centers. the company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the company. long-term contractual obligations the following is a schedule of long-term contractual obligations (as of december 31, 2005) for the consolidated centers over the periods in which they are expected to be paid (in thousands): payment due by period contractual obligations total less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years more than five years long-term debt obligations (includes expected interest payments) $6,547,117 $1,257,222 $2,167,317

$1,329,275 $2,195,641 funds from operations the company uses funds from operations ("ffo") in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") measures. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. ffo and ffo on a fully diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. the macerich company 55 ffo on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. ffo, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts. the reconciliation of ffo and ffo-diluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below. the inclusion of gains (losses) on sales of peripheral land included in ffo for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $3.4 million (including $2.1 million from joint ventures at pro rata), $4.4 million (including $3.5 million from joint ventures at pro rata), $1.4 million (including $0.4 million from joint ventures at pro rata), $2.5 million (including $2.4 million from joint ventures at pro rata), $0.3 million (including $0.1 million from joint ventures at pro rata), respectively. the following reconciles net income available to common

which were subsequently redeemed for common stock on october 4, 2005. (2) the computation of ffo diluted shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method. it also assumes the conversion of macwh, lp units to the extent that it is dilutive to the ffo computation (see note 15-wilmorite acquisition of the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). the convertible debentures were dilutive for the years ended december 31, 2002 and 2001 and were included in the ffo calculation. the convertible debentures were paid off in full on december 13, 2002. on february 25, 1998, the company sold $100 million of its series a preferred stock. on june 16, 1998, the company sold $150 million of its series b preferred stock. on 56 the macerich company september 9, 2003, 5.5 million shares of series b preferred stock were converted into common shares. the preferred stock can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. the then outstanding preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001 ffo-diluted as they are dilutive to that calculation. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2005 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("fv") (dollars in thousands): for the years ended december 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 thereafter total fv consolidated centers: long term debt: fixed rate $57,653 $130,515 $378,414 $399,629 $627,505 $1,630,016 $3,223,732 $2,872,260 average interest rate 5.60% 5.60% 5.50% 5.60% 5.70% 6.30% 5.70% floating rate 894,706 1,178,292 56,000 72,000 2,200,998 2,200,998 average interest rate 5.90% 5.80% 5.20% 5.00% 5.80% total debt consolidated centers $952,359 $1,308,807 $434,414 $399,629 $627,505 $1,702,016 $5,424,730 $5,073,258 joint venture centers: long term debt (at company's pro rata share:) fixed rate $262,023 $132,294 $66,263 $227,644 $118,381 $448,664 $1,255,269 $1,340,256 average interest rate 6.60% 6.90% 6.30% 6.90% 6.30% 6.20% 6.60% floating rate 165,943 50,327 17,984 16,089 250,343 250,343 average interest rate 5.10% 5.20% 5.50% 6.30% 5.20% total debt joint venture centers $427,966 $182,621 $84,247 $243,733 $118,381 $448,664 $1,505,612 $1,590,599 the consolidated centers' total fixed rate debt was $3.2 billion and $1.8 billion at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate was 5.70% and 6.42% and december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt was $2.2 billion and $1.5 billion at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate was 5.80% and 3.89% at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the joint venture centers' fixed rate debt was $1.3 billion and $956.4 million at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate increased to 6.60% at december 31, 2005 from 6.46% at december 31, 2004. the company's pro rata share of the joint venture centers' floating rate debt was $250.3 million and $190.9 million at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate increased from 3.02% at december 31, 2004 to 5.20% at december 31, 2005. the macerich company 57 the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities."

rate at 6.296% (4.796% swap rate plus 1.50%) from december 1, 2005 to april 15, 2010. the fair value of this swap agreement at december 31, 2005 was ($0.9) million. the company has an interest rate cap from july 9, 2004 to august 9, 2007 with a notional amount of $30.0 million on the loan at la cumbre plaza. this interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 7.12%. the fair

similar risk and duration. 58 the macerich company item 8. financial statements and supplementary data refer to the index to financial statements and financial statement schedules for the required information appearing in item 15. item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none item 9a. controls and procedures based on their evaluation as of december 31, 2005, the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. management's report on internal control over financial reporting the company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended). the company's management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2005. in making this assessment, the company's management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control integrated framework. the company's management has concluded that, as of december 31, 2005, its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. the company's independent registered public accounting firm, deloitte and touche llp, has issued an audit report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. the macerich company 59 report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of the macerich company santa monica, california we have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting, that the macerich company and its subsidiaries (the "company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2005, based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 60 the macerich company in our opinion, management's assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31, 2005, of the company and our report dated march 9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules. deloitte &amp; touche llp los angeles, california march 9, 2006 the macerich company 61 changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal controls over

agreements. tenant receivables: included in tenant receivables are allowances for doubtful accounts of $4,588 and $5,604 at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. also included in tenant receivables are accrued percentage rents of $11,423 and $7,174 at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. revenues: minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight-lining of rent adjustment." rental income was increased by $5,666 in 2005, decreased by $1,864 in 2004 and increased by $2,887 in 2003 due to the straight-lining of rent adjustment. percentage rents are recognized and accrued when tenants' specified sales targets have been met. estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. the management companies provide property management, leasing, corporate, development, redevelopment and acquisition services to affiliated and non-affiliated shopping centers. in consideration for these services, the management companies receive monthly management fees generally ranging from 1.5% to 6% of the gross monthly rental revenue of the properties managed. the macerich company 75 property: costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. interest incurred or imputed on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes hvac equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc. are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings and improvements 5-40 years tenant improvements initial term of related lease equipment and furnishings 5-7 years the company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 141, "business combinations." the company determines the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. the company then assigns a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. the balance of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at acquisition date prorated and depreciated over the remaining lease terms. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases, including ground leases, which come in three forms: (i) origination value, which represents the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in our markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. origination value is recorded as an other asset and is amortized over the remaining lease terms. value of in-place leases is recorded as an other asset and amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. above or below market leases are classified as an other asset or liability, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases. 76 the macerich company when the company acquires real estate properties, the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. these allocations also impact depreciation expense, rental revenues and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties. generally, the company engages a valuation firm to assist with the allocation. the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. management believes no such impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at december 31, 2005 and 2004. deferred charges: costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. in-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal. leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual lease years. the range of the terms of the agreements are as follows: deferred lease costs 1-15 years deferred financing costs 1-15 years in-place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs 5-10 years income taxes: the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ended december 31, 1994. to qualify as a reit, the company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. it is management's current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the company's reit status. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income it distributes currently to its stockholders. if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then it will be subject to federal income taxes the macerich company 77 at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years. even if the company qualifies for taxation as a reit, the company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income, if any. each partner is taxed individually on its share of partnership income or loss, and accordingly, no provision for federal and state income tax is provided for the operating partnership in the consolidated financial statements. the following table reconciles net income available to common stockholders to taxable income available to common stockholders for the years ended december 31: 2005 2004 2003 net income

subsidiaries other than its qualified reit subsidiaries. the elections, effective for the year beginning january 1, 2001 and future years, were made pursuant to section 856(l) of the internal revenue code. the company's taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss") are subject to corporate level income taxes which are provided for in the company's consolidated financial statements. the company's primary trss include macerich management company, westcor partners, llc and westcor trs, llc. the income tax benefit of the trss for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 current $1,171 $570 $207 deferred (3,202) (6,036) (651) total income tax benefit $(2,031) $(5,466) $(444) income tax benefit of the trss for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are reconciled to the amount computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate as follows: 2005 2004 2003 book (loss) income for trss $(3,729) $2,595 $5,279 tax at statutory rate on earnings from

recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the trss relate primarily to differences in the book and tax bases of property and to operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided if the company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. realization of the macerich company 79 deferred tax assets is dependent on the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. the net operating loss carryforwards are currently scheduled to expire through 2025, beginning in 2011. the tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards of the trss included in the net deferred tax assets at december 31, 2005 and 2004 are summarized as follows: 2005 2004 net operating loss carryforwards $14,146 $13,876 property, primarily differences in depreciation and amortization, the tax basis of land assets and treatment of certain other costs (5,033) (7,061) other 1,143 915 net deferred tax assets $10,256 $7,730 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets: the company sold paradise village gateway on january 2, 2003 and recorded a loss on sale of $161 for the year ended december 31, 2003. additionally, the company sold bristol center on august 4, 2003, and the results from the period january 1, 2003 to august 4, 2003, have been classified as discontinued operations. the sale of bristol center resulted in a gain of $22,206 in 2003. total revenues associated with bristol center were $2,523 for the period from january 1, 2003 to august 4, 2003. the company sold westbar on december 16, 2004, and the results for the period january 1, 2004 to december 16, 2004 and for the year ended december 31, 2003 have been classified as discontinued operations. the sale of westbar resulted in a gain on sale of asset of $6,781. total revenues associated with westbar were approximately $4,784 for the period january 1, 2004 to december 16, 2004 and $5,738 for the year ended december 31, 2003. on january 5, 2005, the company sold arizona lifestyle galleries for $4,300. the sale of this property resulted in a gain on sale of asset of $297 and the impact on the results for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were insignificant. the company has identified the crossroads mall in oklahoma as an asset for sale and has therefore, classified the properties results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 as discontinued operations. total revenues associated with crossroads mall were approximately $10,921, $11,227 and $12,249 for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the carrying amounts of the properties sold or held for sale include property of $54,853 and $59,371 at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 80 the macerich company variable interest entities the company consolidates all variable interest entities ("vies") in which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no. 46r, "consolidation of variable interest entities" ("fin 46r"). as of december 31, 2005, the company consolidated three vies in connection with its assessment of fin 46r. the impact of consolidating the vies was insignificant at december 31, 2005. fair value of financial instruments the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. the estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange. the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. in accordance with sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities", the company recognizes all derivatives in the consolidated financial statements and measures the derivatives at fair value. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk. the company requires that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. for derivative instruments associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. any instrument that meets these cash flow hedging criteria, and other criteria required by sfas no. 133, is formally designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. the company designs its hedges to be perfectly effective. when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified resulting in some ineffectiveness, the portion of the change in the derivative fair value related to ineffectiveness from period to period will be included in net income. if any derivative instrument used for risk management does not meet the hedging criteria, it is marked-to-market each period in the statement of operations. three of the company's six derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges defined by sfas no. 133. on an ongoing quarterly basis, the company adjusts its balance sheet to reflect the current fair value of its derivatives. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in income or comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction. to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in income. there the macerich company 81 were no ineffective portions during the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. over time, the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income. this reclassification occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in income. the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. to determine the fair value of derivative instruments, the company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination cost at each balance sheet date. all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. as of december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004, the company had $2,762 and $4,109 reflected in other comprehensive income related to treasury rate locks settled in prior years, respectively. the company reclassified $1,351 for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, and $1,328 for the year ended december 31, 2003, related to treasury rate lock transactions settled in prior years from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings. it is anticipated that a similar amount will be reclassified in 2006. interest rate swap and cap agreements are purchased by the company from third parties to hedge the risk of interest rate increases on some of the company's floating rate debt. payments received as a result of the cap agreements are recorded as a reduction of interest expense. the fair value of the cap agreements are included in deferred charges. the fair value of these caps will vary with fluctuations in interest rates and will either be recorded in income or other comprehensive income depending on its effectiveness. the company will be exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to the financial instruments; however, management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counter parties. additionally, the company recorded other comprehensive (loss) income of ($2,356), $2,076 and $1,148 related to the mark to market of interest rate swap/cap agreements for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. the interest rate caps and interest rate swap transactions are described below. the company had an interest rate swap agreement on its $250,000 term note (see note 7 bank notes payable) which effectively fixed the interest rate at 4.45% from november 2003 to its maturity date of october 13, 2005. the fair value of this swap was reflected in other comprehensive income and had a fair value at december 31, 2004 of $1,900. the $450,000 term loan (see note 7 bank notes payable) has an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixes the interest rate at 6.296% (4.796% swap rate plus 1.50%) from december 1, 2005 to april 15, 2010. the fair value of the swap at december 31, 2005 was ($927). 82 the macerich company the company has an interest rate cap from july 9, 2004 to august 9, 2007 with a notional amount of $30,000 on its loan at la cumbre plaza (see note 6 mortgage notes payable). this interest rate cap prevents the libor rate from exceeding 7.12%. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004 was zero. the company has an interest cap from september 9, 2005 to december 15, 2007 with a notional amount of $72,000 on its greece ridge loan. the interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 6.625% through september 15, 2006 and 7.95% through december 15, 2007. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2005 was zero. the company has three interest rate cap agreements that are stand-alone derivative instruments and do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no. 133. changes in the market value of these instruments would be recorded in the statement of operations. earnings per share ("eps"): the computation of basic earnings per share is based on net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. the computation of diluted earnings per share includes the effect of dilutive securities calculated using the treasury stock method. the op units and the westcor partnership units not held by the company have been included in the diluted eps calculation since they may be redeemable on a one-for-one basis, at the company's option. the westcor partnership units were converted to op units on july 27, 2004 which were subsequently redeemed for common stock on october 4, 2005. the following table reconciles the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation: 2005 2004 2003 net income shares per share net income shares per share net income shares per share net income $71,686 $91,633 $128,034 less: preferred

company 83 the minority interest as reflected in the company's consolidated statements of operations has been allocated for eps calculations as follows: 2005 2004 2003 income from continuing operations $11,785 $17,364 $23,066 discontinued operations: gain on sale of assets 46 1,387 4,470 income from discontinued operations 619 1,119 1,371 $12,450 $19,870 $28,907 concentration of risk: the company maintains its cash accounts in a number of commercial banks. accounts at these banks are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") up to $100. at various times during the year, the company had deposits in excess of the fdic insurance limit. no center or tenant generated more than 10% of total revenues during 2005, 2004 or 2003. the centers derived approximately 94.0%, 93.8% and 93.6% of their total minimum rents for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, from mall and freestanding stores. the limited represented 4.1%, 3.6% and 4.3% of total minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and no other retailer represented more than 3.6%, 3.2% and 3.2% of total minimum rents as of december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. management estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. in the year ending december 31, 2004, the company changed its estimate for common area expense recoveries applicable to prior periods. this change in estimate resulted in a $4,129 charge for the year ending december 31, 2004. recent accounting pronouncements in december 2004, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued sfas no. 123 (revised), "share-based payment" sfas no. 123(r) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. the company will adopt the new statement as of january 1, 2006. the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. 84 the macerich company in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 153, "exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of accounting principle board ("apb") opinion no. 29." the guidance in apb opinion no. 29, accounting for nonmonetary transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. the guidance in that opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. sfas no. 153 amends opinion no. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. sfas no. 153 became effective in the first reporting period ending after june 15, 2005. the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. on february 7, 2005, the securities and exchange commission ("sec") staff published certain views concerning the accounting by lessees for leasehold improvements, rent holidays, lessor funding of lessee expenditures and other tenant inducements. although the application of these views to lessors was not specified by the sec and a formal accounting standard modifying existing practice on these items has not been issued or proposed, the company has conducted a detailed evaluation of its accounting relative to such items. the company believes that its leases with its tenants that provide for leasehold improvements funded by the company represent fixed assets that the company owns and controls and that leases with such arrangements are properly accounted for as commencing at the completion of construction of such assets. on tenant leases that do not provide for landlord funding but rather provide for tenant funded construction and furnishing of the leased premises prior to the formal commencement of the lease, the company has concluded that the cumulative incremental straight-line rental revenue that would have been recognized on such leases if it had commenced with the turn-over of such space rather than the lease-specified commencement date to be immaterial. beginning on january 1, 2005, the company began recognizing straight-line rental revenue on this accelerated basis for all new leases. this is not expected to have a material effect on future periods and will have no effect on periodic or cumulative cash flows to be received pursuant to a tenant lease. in june 2005, a consensus was reached by fasb related to issue no. 04-5, "determining whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights." effective for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified, the guidance in this issue became effective after june 29, 2005. for general partners in all other limited partnerships, the guidance in this issue will become effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005, and that application of either one of two transition methods described in the issue would be acceptable. this adoption of this issue is not expected to have a material effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. the macerich company 85 in march 2005, fasb issued fin no. 47, "accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no. 143." fin no. 47, requires that a liability be recognized for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. as a result of the company's evaluation of fin no. 47, the company recorded an additional liability of $615 in 2005. as of december 31, 2005 and 2004, the company's liability for retirement obligations was $1,163 and $619, respectively. in may 2005, the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 154, "accounting changes and error corrections" ("sfas 154"), to replace apb opinion no. 20, "reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements" ("apb 20"). sfas 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. sfas 154 will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005. the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. in june 2005, the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force abstract no. 05-06, "determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination," ("eitf 05-06") to address issues related to the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or placed in service after and not contemplated at the beginning of the lease term. the task force reached a consensus that these types of leasehold improvements should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of the acquisition or the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. this consensus does not apply to preexisting leasehold improvements, but should be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june 29, 2005. the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on the company's results of operations or financial condition. 86 the macerich company

(the "corp"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the macerich company (the "company"), and ontario teachers' pension plan board ("ontario teachers") acquired a portfolio of properties in the first of a two-phase acquisition and formed the pacific premier retail trust (the "trust"). the first phase of the acquisition consisted of three regional malls, the retail component of a mixed-use development and five contiguous properties comprising approximately 3.4 million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately $415,000. the purchase price was funded with a $120,000 loan placed concurrently with the closing, $109,800 of debt from an affiliate of the seller and $39,400 of assumed debt. the balance of the purchase price was paid in cash. the second phase consisted of the acquisition of the office component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of approximately $111,000. the purchase price was funded with a $76,700 loan placed concurrently with the closing and the balance was paid in cash. on october 26, 1999, 99% of the membership interests of los cerritos center and stonewood mall and 100% of the membership interests of lakewood mall were contributed from the company and ontario teachers to the trust. the total value of the transaction was approximately $535,000. the properties were contributed to the trust subject to existing debt of $322,000. the properties were recorded at approximately $453,100 to reflect the cost basis of the assets contributed to the trust. the trust was organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("reit") under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. the corp maintains a 51% ownership interest in the trust, while ontario teachers' maintains a 49% ownership interest in the trust. 116 the macerich company the properties as of december 31, 2005 and their locations are as follows: cascade mall creekside crossing mall cross court plaza kitsap mall kitsap place mall lakewood mall los cerritos center northpoint plaza redmond towne center redmond office stonewood mall washington square mall washington square too burlington, washington redmond, washington burlington, washington silverdale, washington silverdale, washington lakewood, california cerritos, california silverdale, washington redmond, washington redmond, washington downey, california portland, oregon portland, oregon 2. summary of significant accounting policies: cash and cash equivalents: the trust considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, for which cost approximates fair value. tenant receivables: included in tenant receivables are accrued percentage rents of $3,097 and $2,247 and an allowance for doubtful accounts of $392 and $956 at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. revenues: minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight-lining of rent adjustment." rental income was increased (decreased) by $200, ($138) and $586 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to the straight-lining of rents. percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis and are accrued when tenants' specified sales targets have been met. estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. property: costs related to the redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. interest incurred or imputed on redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. the macerich company 117 maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes hvac equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc. are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets as follows: building and improvements 5-39 years tenant improvements initial term of related lease equipment and furnishings 5-7 years the trust assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the trust may recognize an impairment loss if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a property. management believes no such impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at december 31, 2005 and 2004. deferred charges: costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. costs relating to financing of properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. the range of the terms of the agreements is as follows: deferred lease costs 1-9 years deferred financing costs 1-12 years income taxes: the trust elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ended december 31, 1999. to qualify as a reit, the trust must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. it is the trust's current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the trust's reit status. as a reit, the trust generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income it distributes currently to its stockholders. as such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. if the trust fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then it will be subject to federal 118 the macerich company income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years. even if the trust qualifies for taxation as a reit, the trust may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income, if any. the following table reconciles net income to taxable income for the years ended december 31: 2005 2004 2003 net income $46,161 $42,315 $39,095 add: book depreciation and amortization 27,567 26,009 24,610 less: tax depreciation and amortization (26,979) (25,982) (25,335) other book/tax

rents. for income tax purposes, distributions consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof. the following table details the components of the distributions for the years ended december 31: 2005 2004 2003 ordinary income $211.03 25.2% $326.31 99.8% $163.61 77.2% capital gains 0.0% 0.66 0.2% 20.78 9.9% return of capital 627.26 74.8% 0.0% 27.42 12.9% dividends

standards ("sfas") no. 123 (revised), "share-based payment". sfas no. 123(r) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. the trust will adopt the new statement as of january 1, 2006. the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 153, "exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of accounting principle board ("apb") opinion no. 29." the guidance in apb opinion no. 29, accounting for nonmonetary transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. the guidance in that opinion, however, included the macerich company 119 certain exceptions to that principle. sfas no. 153 amends opinion no. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. sfas no. 153 became effective in the first reporting period ending after june 15, 2005. the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. on february 7, 2005, the securities and exchange commission ("sec") staff published certain views concerning the accounting by lessees for leasehold improvements, rent holidays, lessor funding of lessee expenditures and other tenant inducements. although the application of these views to lessors was not specified by the sec and a formal accounting standard modifying existing practice on these items has not been issued or proposed, the trust has conducted a detailed evaluation of its accounting relative to such items. the trust believes that its leases with its tenants that provide for leasehold improvements funded by the trust represent fixed assets that the trust owns and controls and that leases with such arrangements are properly accounted for as commencing at the completion of construction of such assets. on tenant leases that do not provide for landlord funding but rather provide for tenant funded construction and furnishing of the leased premises prior to the formal commencement of the lease, the trust has concluded that the cumulative incremental straight-line rental revenue that would have been recognized on such leases if it had commenced with the turn-over of such space rather than the lease-specified commencement date to be immaterial. beginning on january 1, 2005, the trust began recognizing straight-line rental revenue on this accelerated basis for all new leases. this is not expected to have a material effect on future periods and will have no effect on periodic or cumulative cash flows to be received pursuant to a tenant lease. in june 2005, a consensus was reached by fasb related to issue no. 04-5, "determining whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights." effective for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified, the guidance in this issue became effective after june 29, 2005. for general partners in all other limited partnerships, the guidance in this issue will become effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005, and that application of either one of two transition methods described in the issue would be acceptable. this adoption of this issue is not expected to have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. in march 2005, fasb issued fin no. 47, "accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations-an interpretation of sfas no. 143." fin no. 47, requires that a liability be recognized for the fair value of a 120 the macerich company conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. the adoption of fin no. 47 did not have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. in may 2005, the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 154, "accounting changes and error corrections" ("sfas 154"), to replace apb opinion no. 20, "reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements" ("apb 20"). sfas 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. sfas 154 will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005. the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. in june 2005, the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force abstract no. 05-06, "determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination," ("eitf 05-06") to address issues related to the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or placed in service after and not contemplated at the beginning of the lease term. the task force reached a consensus that these types of leasehold improvements should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of the acquisition or the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. this consensus does not apply to preexisting leasehold improvements, but should be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june 29, 2005. the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. fair value of financial instruments: the trust calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. the estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the trust using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the trust could realize in a current market exchange. the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. the macerich company 121 concentration of risk: the trust maintains its cash accounts in a number of commercial banks. accounts at these banks are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") up to $100. at various times during the year, the trust had deposits in excess of the fdic insurance limit. one tenant represented 10.7%, 11.4% and 11.5% of total minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. no other tenant represented more than 2.8%, 2.8% and 3.5% of total minimum rents as of december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. management estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. 3. property: property is summarized at december 31, 2005 and 2004 as follows: 2005 2004 land $238,569 $238,569 building improvements 871,957 826,280 tenant

december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands) (1) general (a) partnership organization on december 29, 1997, affiliates of simon property group, inc. (simon) and the macerich company (macerich) formed a limited partnership to acquire and operate a portfolio of 12 regional shopping centers. sdg macerich properties, l.p. (the partnership) acquired the properties on february 27, 1998. (b) properties affiliates of simon and macerich each manage six of the shopping centers. the shopping centers and their locations are as follows: simon managed properties: south park mall moline, illinois valley mall harrisonburg, virginia granite run mall media, pennsylvania eastland mall and convenience center evansville, indiana lake square mall leesburg, florida north park mall davenport, iowa macerich managed properties: lindale mall cedar rapids, iowa mesa mall grand junction, colorado south ridge mall des moines, iowa empire mall and empire east sioux falls, south dakota rushmore mall rapid city, south dakota southern hills mall sioux city, iowa the shopping center leases generally provide for fixed annual minimum rent, overage rent based on sales, and reimbursement for certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes. for leases in effect at 132 the macerich company december 31, 2005, fixed minimum rents to be received in each of the next five years and thereafter are summarized as follows: 2006 $78,184 2007 67,250 2008 58,572 2009 48,813 2010 37,787 thereafter 100,222 $390,828 (2) summary of significant accounting policies (a) revenues all leases are classified as operating leases, and minimum rents are recognized monthly on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. most retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year, generally ending on january 31. overage rents are recognized as revenues based on reported and estimated sales for each tenant through december 31. differences between estimated and actual amounts are recognized in the subsequent year. tenant recoveries for real estate taxes and common area maintenance are adjusted annually based on actual expenses, and the related revenues are recognized in the year in which the expenses are incurred. charges for other operating expenses are billed monthly with periodic adjustments based on estimated utility usage and/or a current price index, and the related revenues are recognized as the amounts are billed and as adjustments become determinable. (b) cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. the macerich company 133 (c) properties properties are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings and improvements 39 years equipment and furnishings 5-7 years tenant improvements initial term of related lease improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset. all repairs and maintenance items are expensed as incurred. the partnership assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of a property by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the partnership would recognize an impairment loss if the estimated future income stream of a property is not sufficient to recover its investment. such a loss would be the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a property. management believes no impairment in the net carrying values of its properties has occurred. (d) financing costs financing costs related to the proceeds of mortgage notes issued are amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. (e) use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. (f) income taxes as a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year is includable in the income tax returns of the partners; accordingly, income taxes are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 134 the macerich company (g) derivative financial instruments the partnership uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. the partnership requires that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. for derivative instruments associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. any instrument that meets these hedging criteria is formally designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified resulting in some ineffectiveness, the portion of the change in the derivative fair value related to ineffectiveness from period to period will be included in net income. if any derivative instrument used for risk management does not meet the hedging criteria then it is marked-to-market each period and will be included in net income, however, the partnership intends for all derivative transactions to meet all the hedge criteria and qualify as hedges. on an ongoing quarterly basis, the partnership adjusts its balance sheet to reflect the current fair value of its derivatives. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in income or comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction, and on the type of hedge transaction. to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in income. over time, the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income. this reclassification occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in income. the partnership has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. to determine the fair value of derivative instruments, the partnership uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination cost at each balance sheet date. all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. (3) mortgage notes payable and fair value of financial instruments in connection with the acquisition of the properties in 1998, the partnership assumed $485,000 of mortgage notes secured by the properties. the notes consisted of $300,000 of debt that is due in may 2006 and requires monthly interest payments at a fixed weighted average rate of 7.41% and $185,000 of debt that was due and repaid in may 2003 and required monthly interest payments at a variable weighted average rate (based on libor). the variable rate debt was covered by interest cap agreements that effectively prevented the floating rate from exceeding 11.53%. the fair value assigned to the macerich company 135 the fixed-rate debt assumed at the acquisition date based on an estimated market interest rate of 6.23% was $322,711, with the resulting debt premium being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using a level yield method. at december 31, 2005 and 2004, the unamortized balance of the debt premium was $1,329 and $4,665, respectively. on april 12, 2000, the partnership obtained $138,500 of additional mortgage financing which is also secured by the properties. in connection with obtaining this debt, the partnership repaid $500 of the original floating rate debt. the notes consist of $57,100 of debt that requires monthly interest payments at a fixed weighted average rate of 8.13% and $81,400 of debt that requires monthly interest payments at a variable weighted average rate (based on libor) of 4.74% and 2.77% at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. all of the notes mature on may 15, 2006. the variable rate debt is covered by an interest cap agreement that effectively prevents the variable rate from exceeding 11.83%. in may 2003, $186,500 of proceeds from mortgage notes issued that were secured by the properties were used to repay the remaining assumed debt that was due in may 2003. the notes are due in may 2006 and require monthly interest payments at a variable weighted average rate (based on libor) of 4.79% and 2.81% at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. this debt is covered by interest cap agreements that effectively prevent the variable rate from exceeding 10.63%. management of the partnership anticipates it will successfully refinance the existing debt, all of which matures in may 2006, with debt having terms similar to the current debt. the fair value of the fixed-rate debt of $357,100 at december 31, 2005 and 2004 based on an interest rate of 6.13% and 4.50%, respectively, is estimated to be $359,144 and $371,898, respectively. the carrying value of the variable-rate debt of $267,900 at december 31, 2005 and 2004, and the partnership's other financial instruments are estimated to approximate their fair values. as of december 31, 2005 and 2004, the partnership has recorded its interest rate cap agreements as derivatives at their fair values of $0. these derivatives consist of interest rate cap agreements with a total notional amount of $267,900 at december 31, 2005 and 2004 and a maturity date of may 2006. the partnership's exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates to the partnership's long-term debt obligations. through its risk management strategy, the partnership manages exposure to interest rate market risk by interest rate protection agreements to effectively cap a portion of variable rate debt. the partnership's intent is to minimize its exposure to potential significant increases in interest rates. the partnership does not enter into interest rate protection agreements for speculative purposes. 136 the macerich company (4) related party transactions management fees incurred in 2005, 2004, and 2003 totaled $2,042, $2,028, and $2,038, respectively, for the simon-managed properties and $2,302, $2,012, and $2,030, respectively, for the macerich-managed properties, both based on a fee of 4% of gross receipts, as defined. in addition to the management fees, macerich charged the partnership an additional $521 and $620 for shared services fees in 2005 and 2004, respectively. in 2005, the partnership paid a development fee of $336 to an affiliate of simon in connection with a development project at valley mall. due from affiliates and due to affiliates on the accompanying balance sheets represent amounts due to or from the partnership to simon or macerich or an affiliate of simon or macerich in the normal course of operations of the shopping center properties. (5) contingent liability the partnership is not currently involved with any litigation other than routine and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. on the basis of consultation with counsel, management believes that these items will not have a material adverse impact on the partnership's financial statements taken as a whole. the macerich company 137 the

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2005 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("fv") (dollars in thousands): for the years ended december 31, 2006 2007

december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate was 5.70% and 6.42% and december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt was $2.2 billion and $1.5 billion at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate was 5.80% and 3.89% at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the joint venture centers' fixed rate debt was $1.3 billion and $956.4 million at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate increased to 6.60% at december 31, 2005 from 6.46% at december 31, 2004. the company's pro rata share of the joint venture centers' floating rate debt was $250.3 million and $190.9 million at december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the average interest rate increased from 3.02% at december 31, 2004 to 5.20% at december 31, 2005. the macerich company 57 the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities." (see "notes to consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments") the company's $450.0 million term loan has an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at 6.296% (4.796% swap rate plus 1.50%) from december 1, 2005 to april 15, 2010. the fair value of this swap agreement at december 31, 2005 was ($0.9) million. the company has an interest rate cap from july 9, 2004 to august 9, 2007 with a notional amount of $30.0 million on the loan at la cumbre plaza. this interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 7.12%. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004 was zero. the company's east mesa land and superstition springs joint venture have an interest rate swap through february 15, 2007, which converts $3.4 million of floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% to a fixed rate of 5.39%. this swap has been designated as a hedge in accordance with sfas no. 133. additionally, interest rate caps were simultaneously sold to offset the effect of the interest rate cap agreements. these interest rate caps do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no.133. the company's metrocenter joint venture has an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts the company's $16.8 million share of floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate of 4.80% from january 2005 to february 2008. the fair value of this swap agreement is reflected in other comprehensive income and the company's share of the fair value of this swap agreement at december 31, 2005 was $0.3 million. the company has an interest cap from september 9, 2005 to december 15, 2007 with a notional amount of $72.0 million on its greece ridge loan. the interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 6.625% through september 15, 2006 and 7.95% through december 15, 2007. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2005 was zero. the company's camelback colonnade joint venture has an interest cap from september 30, 2005 to november 17, 2008 with a notional amount of $41.5 million on the loan the property. the interest rate cap prevents the libor interest rate from exceeding 8.54%. the fair value of this cap agreement at december 31, 2005 was zero. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $24.5 million per year based on $2.5 billion outstanding of floating rate debt at december 31, 2005. the fair value of the company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration. 58 the macerich company quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskrisk factors 15 risk factors we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate; the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws, and by interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing. in addition, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we were to sell one or more of our centers, we may receive less money than we originally invested in the center. some of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona and 12 centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factor, or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. our centers must compete with other retail centers and retail formats for tenants and customers. there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the centers in attracting tenants to lease space, and an increasing number of new retail formats and technologies other than retail shopping centers compete with the centers for retail sales. competing retail formats include lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, power centers, discount shopping clubs, mail-order services, internet shopping and home shopping networks. our revenues may be reduced as a result of increased competition. the macerich company 15 our centers depend on tenants to generate rental revenues. our revenues and funds available for distribution will be reduced if: a significant number of our tenants are unable (due to poor operating results, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations; we are unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms; or for any other reason, we are unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. a decision by an anchor, or other significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other anchors and/or other tenants to terminate their leases, seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. the bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, or sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer, may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers decline sufficiently, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. for example, on october 24, 2005, federated department stores, inc. disclosed that it had identified 82 duplicate locations in certain malls to be divested during 2006. in july 2006, we purchased 11 of the identified stores which were located in ten of our centers. on february 1, 2006, musicland holding corp. announced the closure of 341 of its low performing sam goody and suncoast picture stores which include 26 stores located in the centers. approximately 80% of these stores remain vacant. we are contemplating various replacement tenant and/or redevelopment opportunities for all of these vacant stores. no assurance can be given regarding the impact on us of these divestitures or closures or whether we will be successful in leasing or redeveloping these vacant stores. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. 16 the macerich company we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. each of the principals serves as an executive officer and is a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. the guarantees of indebtedness by and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals have guaranteed mortgage loans encumbering one of the centers. as of december 31, 2006, the principals have guaranteed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $21.8 million. the existence of guarantees of these loans by the principals could result in the principals having interests that are inconsistent with the interests of our stockholders. the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. the macerich company 17 if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. 18 the macerich company complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, sell a portion of our investments (potentially at disadvantageous prices) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts for investments. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 42 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in centers that are not wholly owned centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. our holding company structure makes it dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating the macerich company 19 partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of acms into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $115 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $10,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million for both certified and non-certified acts of terrorism. in addition, our ability to maintain this level of terrorism insurance may be adversely impacted by the pending expiration of the terrorism risk insurance act on december 31, 2007. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $10 million three-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on many of the centers for less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, the entity that owns the affected center could lose its capital invested in the center, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the center, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the center. an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact our financial condition. 20 the macerich company as the general partner of the operating partnership and certain of the property partnerships, we are generally liable for any of its unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all four principals). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of common stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. stockholder rights plan and selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. agreements to which we are a party, as well as some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these agreements and provisions include the following: a stockholder rights plan (which is generally triggered when an entity, group or person acquires 15% or more of our common stock), which, in the event of a takeover attempt not approved by our board of directors, allows our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock, or the common stock of the acquiring entity, at a 50% discount; a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors, which may make the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult; advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the macerich company 21 the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's shares) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. risk factors," among others. the company will not update any forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information. management's overview and summary the macerich company (the "company") is involved in the acquisition, ownership,

time based upon demand. groundbreaking took place on february 6, 2007 for the 230,000 square foot life style expansion at the oaks in thousand oaks, california. plans also call for the remodeling of both the interior spaces and the exterior fa&ccedil;ade, and will include a new 138,000 square foot nordstrom scheduled to open at the center in fall 2008. new tenants include abercrombie kids, forever 21, forth &amp; towne, guess?, j. crew, iridesse, planet funk and solstice the macerich company 43 sunglass boutique. the combined expansion and renovation of the center is projected to cost

county. located in casa grande, pinal county, the center will be located along the i-10 corridor between phoenix and tucson. the project is 85% committed, including anchors target and jc penney, and will deliver shopping, dining and entertainment options to a key growth corridor. phase i of the project, which will include a combination of large-format retailers, specialty shops and restaurants, is scheduled for completion in fall 2007. phase ii is comprised of small shops and is scheduled to open in march 2008. the promenade at casa grande is 51% owned by the company. on january 22, 2007, the fairfax county board of supervisors approved plans for a transit-oriented development at tysons corner center in mclean, virginia. the expansion will add 3.5 million square feet of mixed-use space to the existing 2.2 million square foot regional shopping center. the project is planned to be built in phases over the next 10 years based on market demand and the expansion of the area's light rail system. completion of the entitlement process for phase i, totaling roughly 1.4 million square feet, is anticipated for the first quarter of 2008. the first phase of the project is anticipated to begin development in late 2009. in late 2006, plans were announced to bring barneys new york department store to scottsdale fashion square, replacing one of the anchor spaces acquired as a result of the federated-may merger. demolition of the vacant space and adjoining parking structure will begin in 2007, allowing for construction of an additional 100,000 square feet of new shop space and the 65,000-square-foot barneys new york location. this store is anticipated to open in fall 2009. inflation: in the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate. most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index ("cpi"). in addition, about 6%-13% of the leases expire each year, which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. additionally, historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. in january 2005, the company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center. this change shifts the burden of cost control to the company. 44 the macerich company seasonality: the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. in addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. as a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter. critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, and estimates for environmental matters. the company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. however, the following policies are deemed to be critical. revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight lining of rent adjustment." currently, 40% of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases, rather than fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. property costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. interest incurred on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes hvac equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. the macerich company 45 property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings and improvements 5-40 years tenant improvements 5-7 years equipment and furnishings 5-7 years accounting for acquisitions the company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 141, "business combinations." the company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. the company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. the balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. the value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases. when the company acquires real estate properties, the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties. generally, the company engages a valuation firm to assist with these allocations. asset impairment the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenant's ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment. such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center. 46 the macerich company deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. in-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal. leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual remaining lease years. the ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows: deferred lease costs 1-15 years deferred financing costs 1-15 years in-place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs 5-10 years results of operations many

party management contracts and increased development fees from joint ventures. shopping center and operating expenses shopping center and operating expenses increased $38.2 million or 17.1% from 2005 to 2006. approximately $25.6 million of the increase in shopping center and operating expenses related to the 2005 acquisition centers, $5.0 million related to the 2006 acquisition centers and $8.0 million related to the same centers offset in part by a $0.5 million decrease at the redevelopment centers. management companies' operating expenses management companies' operating expenses increased to $56.7 million in 2006 from $52.8 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the additional costs of managing the joint venture acquisition centers and third party managed properties. reit general and administrative expenses reit general and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense in 2006. depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased $31.1 million in 2006 from 2005. the increase is primarily attributed to the 2005 acquisition centers of $17.8 million, the 2006 acquisition centers of $6.2 million and the same centers of $7.4 million. interest expense interest expense increased $37.6 million in 2006 from 2005. approximately $13.8 million of the increase relates to the term loan associated with the 2005 acquisition centers, $12.4 million relates to assumed debt from the 2005 acquisition centers, $5.3 million relates to the 2006 acquisition centers, $13.3 million relates to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under the company's line of credit, $6.7 million relates to higher interest rates on the $250 million term loan and approximately $8.9 million relates to increased interest expense due to 48 the macerich company refinancings and higher rates on floating rate debt regarding the same centers. these increases were offset in part by an approximately $1.3 million decrease in interest expense at the redevelopment centers and $21.6 million relating to the pay off of the acquisition loan associated with the 2005 acquisition centers.

increase in interest expense from the sdg macerich properties, l.p. joint venture (see "item 1. business recent developments financing activities"). loss on early extinguishment of debt the company recorded a loss from the early extinguishment of debt of $1.8 million in 2006 related to the pay off of the $619 million acquisition loan on january 19, 2006. in 2005, the company recorded a loss on

"management's overview and summary acquisitions and dispositions"). as result of the sales, the company reclassified the results of operations for these properties for 2006 and 2005. minority interest in the operating partnership the minority interest in the operating partnership represents the 15.8% weighted average interest of the operating partnership not owned by the company during 2006 compared to the 19.0% not owned by the company during 2005. the change is primarily due to the stock offering by the company in january 2006. funds from operations primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, funds from operations ("ffo") diluted increased 13.7% to $383.1 million in 2006 from $336.8 million in 2005. for the reconciliation of ffo and ffo-diluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "funds from operations." operating activities cash flow from operations decreased to $211.9 million in 2006 from $235.3 million in 2005. the decrease is primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005 and due to the results at the centers as discussed above. investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased to $126.7 million in 2006 from $131.9 million in 2005. the decrease is primarily attributed to the cash used to acquire the 2006 acquisition centers and increases in development and redevelopment costs at the centers. this is offset by $610.6 million in proceeds from the sale of assets in 2006 (see "management's overview and summary acquisitions and dispositions"). the macerich company 49 financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities was $29.2 million in 2006 compared to cash used in financing activities of $20.3 million in 2005. the increase is primarily attributed to the net proceeds of

2004 acquisition centers which is offset by decreases resulting from the company structuring the majority of its new leases using an annual multiple of cpi increases, which generally do not require straight-lining treatment. the amortization of above and below market leases, which is recorded in minimum rents, increased to $11.6 million in 2005 from $9.2 million in 2004. the increase is primarily due to the 2005 acquisition centers and the 2004 acquisition centers. tenant recoveries increased to $214.8 million in 2005 from $145.1 million in 2004. approximately $52.9 million of the

minority interest in the operating partnership the minority interest in the operating partnership represents the 19.0% weighted average interest of the operating partnership not owned by the company during 2005. this compares to 19.5% not owned by the company during 2004. the macerich company 51 funds from operations primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, ffo diluted increased 12.6% to $336.8 million in 2005 from $299.2 million in 2004. for the reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income available to common stockholders, see "funds from operations." operating activities cash flow from operations was $235.3 million in 2005 compared to $213.2 million in 2004. the increase is primarily due to the foregoing results at the centers and offset by an increase in working capital. investing activities cash used in investing activities was $131.9 million in 2005 compared to $489.8 million in 2004. the change resulted primarily from increases in distributions of capital from unconsolidated joint ventures. this is offset by the joint venture acquisitions of metrocenter and kierland commons, the company's additional contributions to northpark center and the decreased development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of centers in 2005 compared to 2004 due to completion of the queens center and la encantada projects. financing activities cash flow used in financing activities was $20.3 million in 2005 compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of $308.4 million in 2004. the 2005 decrease compared to 2004 resulted primarily from fewer refinancings for 2005 than 2004 and increased dividend payments to common stockholders. additionally, the funding of the queens construction loan was $65.7 million less in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the substantial completion of the expansion project. liquidity and capital resources the company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves, property secured borrowings, unsecured corporate borrowings and borrowings under the revolving line of credit. the company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with reit requirements. the company anticipates that cash generated from

the following tables summarize capital expenditures incurred at the centers for the years ended december 31: (dollars in thousands) consolidated centers: 2006 2005 2004 acquisitions of property and equipment $580,542 $1,767,237 $301,061 development, redevelopment and expansion of centers 174,522 77,254 139,292 renovations of centers 51,406 51,092 21,240 tenant allowances 35,603 21,765 10,876 deferred leasing charges 22,776 21,836 16,822 $864,849 $1,939,184 $489,291 joint venture centers (at company's pro rata share): acquisitions of property and equipment $28,732 $736,451 $41,174

debt financings which include borrowings under the company's line of credit and construction loans. however, many factors impact the company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. the company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2006 was $6.6 billion (including $1.7 billion of its pro rata share of joint venture debt). this equated to a debt to total market capitalization (defined as total debt of the company, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of op units, macwh, lp units and preferred stock into common stock) ratio of approximately 45.5% at december 31, 2006. the majority of the company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties. the company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective june 6, 2002, to sell securities. the shelf registration is for a total of $1.0 billion of common stock, common stock warrant or common stock rights. the company sold a total of 15.2 million shares of common

totaling $796.5 million with an average interest rate of 5.81%. the company's pro rata share of the net proceeds of approximately $85.5 million was used to pay down the company's line of credit. the company had a $1.0 billion revolving line of credit that was set to mature on july 30, 2007 plus a one-year extension. the interest rate fluctuated from libor plus 1.15% to libor plus 1.70% depending on the company's overall leverage level. on july 20, 2006, the company amended and expanded the revolving line of credit to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity to april 25, 2010 with a one-year extension option. the interest rate, after amendment, will fluctuate from libor plus 1.0% to libor plus 1.35% depending on the company's overall leverage. in september 2006, the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate on $400.0 million of the outstanding balance of the line of credit at 6.23% until april 25, 2011. as of december 31, 2006 and 2005, borrowings outstanding were $934.5 million and $863.0 million at an average interest rate, net of the $400.0 million swapped portion, of 6.60% and 5.93%, respectively. on may 13, 2003, the company issued $250.0 million in unsecured notes maturing in may 2007 with a one-year extension option bearing interest at libor plus 2.50%. on april 25, 2005, concurrent with the wilmorite

compliance with all applicable loan covenants. at december 31, 2006, the company had cash and cash equivalents available of $269.4 million. off-balance sheet arrangements the company has an ownership interest in a number of joint ventures as detailed in note 4 to the company's consolidated financial statements included herein. the company accounts for those investments that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the company as "investments in unconsolidated joint ventures." a pro rata share of the mortgage debt on these properties is shown in item 2. properties mortgage debt. 54 the macerich company in addition, certain joint ventures also have debt that could become recourse debt to the company or its subsidiaries, in excess of it's pro rata share, should the joint ventures be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt. the following reflects the maximum amount of debt principal that could recourse to the company at december 31, 2006 (in thousands): property recourse debt maturity date boulevard shops $4,280 12/16/2007 chandler village center 4,290 12/19/2007 $8,570 the above amounts decreased $13.1 million from december 31, 2005. additionally, as of december 31, 2006, the company is contingently liable for $6.1 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the company of certain obligations relating to the centers. the company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the company. long-term contractual obligations the following is a schedule of long-term contractual obligations (as of december 31, 2006) for the consolidated centers over the periods in which they are expected to be paid (in thousands): payment due by period contractual obligations total less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years more than five years long-term debt obligations (includes expected interest payments) $6,084,855 $865,129 $1,313,134 $2,596,702 $1,309,890 operating lease obligations 263,898 5,251 10,576 10,700 237,371 purchase obligations 31,111 31,111 other long-term liabilities 304,575 304,575 $6,684,439 $1,206,066 $1,323,710 $2,607,402 $1,547,261 funds from operations the company uses funds from operations ("ffo") in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") measures. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. ffo and ffo on a fully diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization as the the macerich company 55 company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. ffo on a fully diluted basis is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. ffo, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts. the reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below. the following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to ffo and ffo diluted (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 net income available to common stockholders $228,022 $52,588 $82,493 $113,218 $60,965 adjustments to reconcile net income to ffo basic: minority interest in the

company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2006 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("fv") (dollars in thousands): for the years ending december 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 thereafter total fv consolidated centers:

have effective fixed rates over the remaining terms due to swap agreements as discussed below. the consolidated centers' total fixed rate debt at december 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on fixed rate debt at december 31, 2006 and 2005 was 5.99% and 5.70%, respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2006 and 2005 was $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on floating rate debt at december 31, 2006 and 2005 was 6.59% and 5.80%, respectively. the company's pro rata

the average interest rate on the floating rate debt was 6.33% and 5.20%, respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with sfas no. 133, the macerich company 57 "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities" (see "note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities" of the company's consolidated financial statements). the following are outstanding derivatives at december 31, 2006 (amounts in thousands):

percentage. interest rate cap agreements ("cap") offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule and interest rate swap agreements ("swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $13.8 million per year based on $1.4 billion outstanding of floating rate debt at december 31, 2006. the fair value of the company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration. 58 the macerich company item 8. financial statements and supplementary data refer to the index to financial statements and financial statement schedules for the required information appearing in item 15. item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none item 9a. controls and procedures management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. however, based on their evaluation as of december 31, 2006, the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. management's report on internal control over financial reporting the company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended). the company's management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2006. in making this assessment, the company's management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control integrated framework. the company's management has concluded that, as of december 31, 2006, its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. the company's independent registered public accounting firm, deloitte and touche llp, has issued an audit report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. the macerich company 59 report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of the macerich company santa monica, california we have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting, that the macerich company and its subsidiaries (the "company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2006, based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 60 the macerich company in our opinion, management's assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31, 2006, of the company and our report dated february 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules. deloitte &amp; touche llp los angeles, california february 27, 2007 the macerich company 61 changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in the

financial statements. the macerich company 71 the macerich company notes to consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 1. organization: the macerich company (the "company") is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community shopping centers (the "centers") located throughout the united states. the company commenced operations effective with the completion of its initial public offering on march 16, 1994. as of december 31, 2006, the company is the sole general partner of and assuming conversion of the preferred units holds an 84% ownership interest in the macerich partnership, l.p. (the "operating partnership"). the interests in the operating partnership are known as op units. op units not held by the company are redeemable, subject to certain restrictions, on a one-for-one basis for the company's common stock or cash at the company's option. the company was organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("reit") under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. the 16% limited partnership interest of the operating partnership not owned by the company is reflected in these financial statements as minority interest. the property management, leasing and redevelopment of the company's portfolio is provided by the company's management companies, macerich property management company, llc, ("mpmc, llc") a single member delaware limited liability company, macerich management company ("mmc"), a california corporation, westcor partners, l.l.c., a single member arizona limited liability company, macerich westcor management llc, a single member delaware limited liability company and westcor partners of colorado, llc, a colorado limited liability company. as part of the wilmorite closing (see note 12 acquisitions), the company acquired macw mall management, inc., a new york corporation and macw property management, llc, a new york single member limited liability company. these two management companies are collectively referred to herein as the "wilmorite management companies." the three westcor management companies are collectively referred to herein as the "westcor management companies." all seven of the management companies are collectively referred to herein as the "management companies." 2. summary of significant accounting policies: basis of presentation: these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") in the united states of america. the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and the operating partnership. investments in entities that are controlled by the company or meet the definition of a variable interest entity in which an enterprise absorbs the majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity are consolidated; otherwise they are accounted for under the equity method and are reflected as "investments in unconsolidated joint ventures". all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 72 the macerich company cash and cash equivalents: the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, for which cost approximates fair value. restricted cash includes impounds of property taxes and other capital reserves required under the loan agreements. tenant receivables: included in tenant receivables are allowances for doubtful accounts of $2,700 and $4,588 at december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. also included in tenant receivables are accrued percentage rents of $11,086 and $11,423 at december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. revenues: minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight-lining of rent adjustment." rental income was increased by $7,759, $6,703 and $1,037 due to the straight-lining of rent adjustment during the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. percentage rents are recognized and accrued when tenants' specified sales targets have been met. estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. the management companies provide property management, leasing, corporate, development, redevelopment and acquisition services to affiliated and non-affiliated shopping centers. in consideration for these services, the management companies receive monthly management fees generally ranging from 1.5% to 6% of the gross monthly rental revenue of the properties managed. property: costs related to the development, redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. interest incurred on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes hvac equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. the macerich company 73 property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings and improvements 5-40 years tenant improvements 5-7 years equipment and furnishings 5-7 years acquisitions: the company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 141, "business combinations." the company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an "as if vacant" methodology. the company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition. the balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities. tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with "cost avoidance" of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the "assumed vacant" property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. the value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases. above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market, and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases. when the company acquires real estate properties, the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions. these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties. generally, the company engages a valuation firm to assist with these allocations. 74 the macerich company marketable securities: the company accounts for its investments in marketable securities as held-to-maturity debt securities under the provisions of sfas no. 115, "accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities," as the company has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until maturity. accordingly, investments in marketable securities are carried at their amortized cost. the discount on marketable securities is amortized into interest income on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes, which approximates the effective interest method. deferred charges: costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. in-place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal. leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the individual lease years. the range of the terms of the agreements is as follows: deferred lease costs 1-15 years deferred financing costs 1-15 years in-place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs 5-10 years accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets: the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by an undiscounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. management does not believe impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at december 31, 2006 or 2005. fair value of financial instruments the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. the estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the company using available market the macerich company 75 information and appropriate valuation methodologies. however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange. the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. concentration of risk: the company maintains its cash accounts in a number of commercial banks. accounts at these banks are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") up to $100. at various times during the year, the company had deposits in excess of the fdic insurance limit. no center or tenant generated more than 10% of total revenues during 2006, 2005 or 2004. the limited represented 3.5%, 4.1% and 3.6% of total minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and no other retailer represented more than 2.9%, 3.6% and 3.2% of total minimum rents as of december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. management estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. in the year ending december 31, 2004, the company changed its estimate for common area expense recoveries applicable to prior periods. this change in estimate resulted in a $4,129 charge for the year ending december 31, 2004. recent accounting pronouncements: in december 2004, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued sfas no. 123 (revised), "share-based payment." sfas no. 123(r) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. the company adopted this statement as of january 1, 2006. see note 16 share-based plans, for the impact of the adoption of sfas no. 123(r) on the results of operations. in march 2005, fasb issued interpretation no. 47 ("fin 47"), "accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no. 143." fin 47, requires that a liability be recognized for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. as a result of the company's adoption of fin 47, the company recorded an additional liability of $615 in 2005. as of december 31, 2006 and 2005, the company's liability for retirement obligations was $414 and $1,163, respectively. 76 the macerich company in february 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 155, "accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no. 133 and 140." this statement amended sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," and no. 140, "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities." sfas no. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. this statement also established a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. the company is required to adopt sfas no. 155 for fiscal year 2007 and does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. in june 2006, the fasb issued interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109" ("fin 48"). this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with sfas no. 109, "accounting for income taxes." this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of previously recognized income tax benefits, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006. the company has concluded that the adoption of fin 48 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, "fair value measurements." sfas no. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. the company is required to adopt sfas no. 157 for fiscal year 2008 and does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. in september 2006, the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin ("sab") no. 108. sab no. 108 establishes a framework for quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements. sab no. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 16, 2006. the adoption of sab no. 108 did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 3. earnings per share ("eps"): the computation of basic earnings per share is based on net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. the computation of diluted earnings per share includes the effect of dilutive securities calculated using the treasury stock method. the op units not held by the company have been included in the diluted eps calculation since they may be redeemable on a one-for-one basis, at the company's option. the macerich company 77 the following table reconciles the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended december 31:

include convertible preferred unit dividends of $14,253 and $9,449 for the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively (see note 12 acquisitions). (2) the preferred stock (see note 21 cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock) can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. the convertible preferred stock was dilutive to net income in 2006 and antidilutive for 2005 and 2004. the minority interest of the operating partnership as reflected in the company's consolidated statements of operations has been allocated for eps calculations as follows for the years ended december 31: 2006 2005 2004 income from continuing operations $8,634 $9,756 $15,597 discontinued operations: gain on sale of assets 32,390 53 1,475 income

period based on the percentile ranking of the company in terms of total return to stockholders (the "total return") per common stock share relative to the total return of a group of peer reits, as measured at the end of each year of the measurement period. upon the occurence of specified events and subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting conditions, ltip units are ultimately redeemable for common stock on a one-unit for one-share basis. ltip units receive cash dividends based on the dividend amount paid on the common stock. on october 26, 2006, the company granted 215,709 ltip units to four executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $80.04. none of the granted ltip units were vested at december 31, 2006. compensation expense for ltip units was

when modeling in financial markets, as it allows the modeled quantity (in this case, the stock price) to vary randomly from its current value and take any value greater than zero. the volatilities of the returns on the price of the company and the peer group reits were estimated based on a three year look-back period. the expected growth rate of the stock prices over the three year "derived service period" were determined with consideration of the three year risk free rate as of the grant date. 102 the macerich company stock options on october 8, 2003, the company granted 2,500 stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $39.43. these outstanding stock options vested six months after the grant date and were issued with a strike price equal to the fair value of the common stock at the grant date. the term of these stock options is ten years from the grant date. the company has not issued stock options since 2003. all outstanding stock options were fully vested as of december 31, 2004 and therefore, were not impacted by the adoption of sfas no. 123(r). the following table summarizes the activity of non-vested stock awards during the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: stock awards number of shares weighted average grant date fair value balance at january 1, 2004 681,550 $29.33 granted 153,692 $53.90 vested (320,114) $27.68 forfeited (3,982) $34.76

compensation and to receive that compensation in common stock rather than in cash after termination of service or a predetermined period. compensation generally includes the annual retainer and regular meeting fees payable by the company to the directors. every director has elected to receive their compensation in common stock. deferred amounts are credited as units of phantom stock at the beginning of the macerich company 103 each three-year deferral period by dividing the present value of the deferred compensation by the average fair market value of the company's common stock at the date of award. compensation expense related to the phantom stock award was determined by the amortization of the value of the stock units on a straight-line basis over the applicable three-year service period. the stock units (including dividend equivalents) vest as the directors' services (to which the fees relate) are rendered. vested phantom stock units are ultimately paid out in common stock on a one-unit for one-share basis. stock units receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional stock units, based on the dividend amount paid on the common stock. compensation expense for stock awards was $534, $1,128 and $1,750 for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the aggregate number of phantom stock units that may be granted under the directors' phantom stock plan is 250,000. as of december 31, 2006, there were 131,084 units available for grant under the directors' phantom stock plan. as of december 31, 2006, there was no unrecognized cost

of vested phantom stock units. employee stock purchase plan: the espp authorizes eligible employees to purchase the company's common stock through voluntary payroll deduction made during periodic

shares of common stock is available for purchase under the espp. the number of shares available for future purchase under the plan at december 31, 2006 was 732,821. 104 the macerich company other

additional shares may be issued under these plans. all stock options outstanding under these plans were fully vested as of december 31, 2005 and were, therefore, not impacted by the adoption of sfas no. 123(r). as of december 31, 2006, all of the outstanding shares are exercisable at a weighted average price of $24.07. the weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding and exercisable was three years. 17. profit sharing plan: the company has a retirement profit sharing plan that covers substantially all of its eligible employees. the plan is qualified in accordance with section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. effective january 1, 1995, this plan was modified to include a 401(k) plan whereby employees can elect to defer compensation subject to internal revenue service withholding rules. this plan was further amended effective february 1, 1999, to add the macerich company common stock fund as a new investment alternative under the plan. a total of 150,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the plan. contributions by the company to the plan were made at the discretion of the board of directors and were based upon a specified percentage of employee compensation. the company contributed $1,694 during the year ended december 31, 2004. on january 1, 2004, the plan adopted the "safe harbor" provision under sections 401(k)(12) and 401(m)(11) of the internal revenue code. in accordance with these newly adopted provisions, the company began matching contributions equal to 100 percent of the first three percent of compensation deferred by a participant and 50 percent of the next two percent of compensation deferred by a participant. during the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005, these matching contributions made by the company were $1,747 and $1,984, respectively. contributions are recognized as compensation in the period they are made. 18. deferred compensation plans: the company has established deferred compensation plans under which key executives of the company may elect to defer receiving a portion of their cash compensation otherwise payable in one calendar year until a later year. the company may, as determined by the board of directors at its sole discretion, credit a participant's account with an amount equal to a percentage of the participant's deferral. the company contributed $712, $595 and $632 to the plans during the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. contributions are recognized as compensation in the periods they are made. in addition, certain executives have split dollar life insurance agreements with the company whereby the company generally pays annual premiums on a life insurance policy in an amount equal to the executives deferral under one of the company's deferred compensation plans. since july 30, 2002, the effective date of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the company has not made any premium payments on the policies. the macerich company 105 19. income taxes: the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code with its taxable year ended december 31, 1994. to qualify as a reit, the company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. it is management's current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the company's reit status. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income it distributes currently to its stockholders. if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years. even if the company qualifies for taxation as a reit, the company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income, if any. each partner is taxed individually on its share of partnership income or loss, and accordingly, no provision for federal and state income tax is provided for the operating partnership in the consolidated financial statements. the following table reconciles net income available to common stockholders to taxable income available to common stockholders for the year ended december 31: 2006 2005 2004 net income available to common stockholders $228,022 $52,588 $82,493 add: book

organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("reit") under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. the corp maintains a 51% ownership interest in the trust, while ontario teachers' maintains a 49% ownership interest in the trust. 2. summary of significant accounting policies: cash and cash equivalents: the trust considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, for which cost approximates fair value. tenant receivables: included in tenant receivables are accrued percentage rents of $2,540 and $3,097 and an allowance for doubtful accounts of $442 and $392 at december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. the macerich company 115 revenues: minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease. the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight-lining of rent adjustment." rental income was increased (decreased) by $104, $200 and ($138) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to the straight-lining of rents. percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis and are accrued when tenants' specified sales targets have been met. estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred or as specified in the leases. property: costs related to the redevelopment, construction and improvement of properties are capitalized. interest incurred or imputed on redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete. maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred. costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes hvac equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc. are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets as follows: building and improvements 5-39 years tenant improvements 5-7 years equipment and furnishings 5-7 years the trust assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long-lived assets by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. the amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a undiscounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. management does not believe impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at december 31, 2006 or 2005. 116 the macerich company deferred charges: costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. costs relating to financing of properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. the range of terms of the agreements is as follows: deferred lease cost 1-9 years deferred finance costs 1-12 years included in deferred charges are accumulated amortization of $12,209 and $9,266 at december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. fair value of financial instruments the trust calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. the estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the trust using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the trust could realize in a current market exchange. the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. concentration of risk: the trust maintains its cash accounts in a number of commercial banks. accounts at these banks are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") up to $100. at various times during the year, the trust had deposits in excess of the fdic insurance limit. one tenant represented 10.6%, 10.7% and 11.4% of total minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. no other tenant represented more than 10% of total minimum rents as of december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. management estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. the macerich company 117 recent accounting pronouncements: in december 2004, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued statement of financial accounting standards ("sfas") no. 123 (revised), "share-based payment" sfas no. 123(r) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the results of operations. in march 2005, fasb issued fin no. 47, "accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no. 143." fin no. 47, requires that a liability be recognized for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. the adoption of fin no. 47 did not have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. in june 2006, the fasb issued interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109" ("fin 48"). this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with sfas no. 109, "accounting for income taxes." this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of previously recognized income tax benefits, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006. the trust has concluded that the adoption of fin 48 will not have a material impact on its financial statements. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, "fair value measurements." sfas no. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. the company is required to adopt sfas no. 157 for fiscal year 2008 and does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on the trust's results of operations or financial condition. in september 2006, the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin ("sab") no. 108. sab no. 108 establishes a framework for quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements. sab no. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 16, 2006. the adoption of sab no. 108 did not have a material impact on the trust's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. in february 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 155, "accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no. 133 and 140." this statement amended sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities," and no. 140, "accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities." sfas no. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. this statement also established a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests 118 the macerich company that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. the trust is required to adopt sfas no. 155 for fiscal year 2007 and does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on the its results of operations or financial condition. 3. property: property is summarized at december 31, 2006 and 2005 as follows: 2006 2005 land $238,569 $238,569 building improvements

with its taxable year ended december 31, 1999. to qualify as a reit, the trust must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. it is the trust's current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the trust's reit status. as a reit, the trust generally will not be

december 29, 1997, affiliates of simon property group, inc. (simon) and the macerich company (macerich) formed a limited partnership to acquire and operate a portfolio of 12 regional shopping centers. sdg macerich properties, l.p. (the partnership) acquired the properties on february 27, 1998. (b) properties affiliates of simon and macerich each manage six of the shopping centers. the shopping centers and their locations are as follows: simon managed properties: south park mall moline, illinois valley mall harrisonburg, virginia granite run mall media, pennsylvania eastland mall and convenience center evansville, indiana lake square mall leesburg, florida north park mall davenport, iowa macerich managed properties: lindale mall cedar rapids, iowa mesa mall grand junction, colorado south ridge mall des moines, iowa empire mall and empire east sioux falls, south dakota rushmore mall rapid city, south dakota southern hills mall sioux city, iowa the shopping center leases generally provide for fixed annual minimum rent, overage rent based on sales, and reimbursement for certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes. for leases in effect the macerich company 129 at december 31, 2006, fixed minimum rents to be received in each of the next five years and thereafter are summarized as follows: 2007 $78,293 2008 67,347 2009 55,933 2010 44,548 2011 33,208 thereafter 89,232 $368,561 (2) summary of significant accounting policies (c) revenues all leases are classified as operating leases, and minimum rents are recognized monthly on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. most retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year, generally ending on january 31. overage rents are recognized as revenues based on reported and estimated sales for each tenant through december 31. differences between estimated and actual amounts are recognized in the subsequent year. tenant recoveries for real estate taxes and common area maintenance are adjusted annually based on actual expenses, and the related revenues are recognized in the year in which the expenses are incurred. charges for other operating expenses are billed monthly with periodic adjustments based on estimated utility usage and/or a current price index, and the related revenues are recognized as the amounts are billed and as adjustments become determinable. (d) cash equivalents all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. 130 the macerich company (e) properties properties are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings and improvements 35-39 years equipment and furnishings 5-7 years tenant improvements initial term of related lease improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset. all repairs and maintenance items are expensed as incurred. interest incurred or imputed on development, redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until the projects are ready for their intended purpose. the partnership assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of a property by considering factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. such factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. the partnership would recognize an impairment loss if the estimated future income stream of a property is not sufficient to recover its investment. such a loss would be the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a property. management believes no impairment in the net carrying values of its properties has occurred. (f) financing costs financing costs related to the proceeds of mortgage notes issued are amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. (g) use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. the macerich company 131 (h) income taxes as a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the year is includable in the income tax returns of the partners; accordingly, income taxes are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. (i) derivative financial instruments the partnership uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. the partnership requires that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. for derivative instruments associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction, hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs. any instrument that meets these hedging criteria is formally designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified resulting in some ineffectiveness, the portion of the change in the derivative fair value related to ineffectiveness from period to period will be included in net income. if any derivative instrument used for risk management does not meet the hedging criteria, then it is marked-to-market each period and will be included in net income; however, the partnership intends for all derivative transactions to meet all the hedge criteria and qualify as hedges. on an ongoing quarterly basis, the partnership adjusts its balance sheet to reflect the current fair value of its derivatives. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in income or comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction, and on the type of hedge transaction. to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in income. over time, the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income. this reclassification occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in income. the partnership has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. to determine the fair value of derivative instruments, the partnership uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination cost at each balance sheet date. all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. 132 the macerich company (3) mortgage notes payable and fair value of financial instruments on may 10, 2006, the partnership repaid all of its existing mortgage notes payable on their maturity date with the proceeds from seven different mortgage notes payable totaling $796,550. all of the new mortgage notes payable are at fixed interest rates with maturities of june 1, 2016. each of the seven non-recourse mortgage notes is collateralized by different shopping center properties. mortgage notes payable at december 31, 2006 consist of the following: property pledged as collateral original principal balance interest rate type of payments balance at december 31, 2006 eastland mall $168,000 5.794% interest only $168,000 granite run mall 122,000 5.834% principal and interest 121,190 valley mall 47,500 5.834% principal and interest 47,184 empire mall 176,300 5.794% interest only 176,300 mesa mall 87,250 5.794% interest only 87,250 rushmore mall 94,000 5.794% interest only 94,000 southern hills mall 101,500 5.794% interest only 101,500 $796,550 $795,424 total interest expense capitalized in 2006 was $207. the above mortgage notes payable matures as follows: year ending december 31, 2007 $2,075 2008 2,175 2009 2,335 2010 2,479 2011 2,627 thereafter 783,733 $795,424 at december 31, 2005, mortgage notes payable consisted of $357,100 of debt that required monthly interest payments at fixed rates of interest ranging from 7.24% to 8.28% (weighted average rate of 7.53%) and $267,900 of debt that required monthly interest payments at variable rates of interest (based on libor) with rates ranging from 4.709% to 4.839% at december 31, 2005. the balance at december 31, 2005 also included $1,329 of unamortized debt premium that was recorded on debt assumed by the partnership when the properties were initially acquired in 1998 and was being amortized to interest expense using a level yield method. the macerich company 133 the variable rate debt at december 31, 2005 totaling $267,900 was covered by two separate interest rate cap agreements that effectively prevented the variable interest rate from exceeding rates ranging from 10.63% to 11.83%. the partnership's exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates to long-term variable rate debt obligations. through its risk management strategy, the partnership manages exposure to interest rate market risk by interest rate protection agreements to effectively cap a portion of variable rate debt. the partnership's intent is to minimize its exposure to potential significant increases in interest rates. the partnership does not enter into interest rate protection agreements for speculative purposes. the fair value of the fixed-rate debt of $795,424 and $357,100 at december 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, based on an interest rates of 5.70% and 6.13%, respectively, is estimated to be $801,352 and $359,144, respectively. the carrying value of the variable-rate debt of $267,900 at december 31, 2005, and the partnership's other financial instruments at december 31, 2006 and 2005 are estimated to approximate their fair values. (4) related party transactions management fees incurred in 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled $2,063, $2,042, and $2,028, respectively, for the simon-managed properties and $2,101, $2,302, and $2,012, respectively, for the macerich-managed properties, both based on a fee of 4% of gross receipts, as defined. in addition to the management fees, macerich charged the partnership an additional $627, $521, and $620 for shared services fees in 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively. in 2005, the partnership paid a development fee of $336 to an affiliate of simon in connection with a development project at valley mall. due from affiliates and due to affiliates on the accompanying balance sheets represent amounts due to or from the partnership to simon or macerich or an affiliate of simon or macerich in the normal course of operations of the shopping center properties. (5) contingent liabilities the partnership is not currently involved with any litigation other than routine and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. on the basis of consultation with counsel, management believes that these items will not have a material adverse impact on the partnership's financial statements taken as a whole. (6) subsequent event in january 2007, the partnership sold a portion of the shopping center at eastland mall that had previously been occupied by a major tenant to another major tenant. the sale of the land and building resulted in a loss of approximately $4,800 which was recognized at the time of the sale in 2007. 134 the macerich company the macerich company notes to financial statements

repurchase: on march 16, 2007, the company repurchased 807,000 common shares for $75.0 million concurrent with the offering of convertible senior notes (see "financing activity"). these shares were repurchased pursuant to the company's stock repurchase program authorized by the company's board of directors on march 9, 2007. this repurchase program ended on march 16, 2007 because the maximum shares allowed to be repurchased under the program was reached. acquisitions and dispositions: on september 5, 2007, the company purchased the remaining 50% outside ownership interest in hilton village, a 96,546 square foot specialty center in scottsdale, arizona. the total purchase price of $13.5 million was funded by cash, borrowings under the company's line of credit and the assumption of the $8.6 million mortgage note payable on the property. on december 17, 2007, the company purchased a portfolio of fee simple and/or ground leasehold interests in 39 freestanding mervyn's department stores located in the southwest united states for $400.2 million. the purchase price was funded by cash and borrowings under the company's line of credit. concurrent with the acquisition, the company entered into 39 individual agreements to leaseback the properties to mervyns from terms of 14 to 20 years. the company has designated the 27 freestanding mervyn's stores located at shopping centers not owned or managed by the company as available for sale. on january 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the company, at the election of the holders, redeemed approximately 3.4 million participating convertible preferred units ("pcpus") (the common stock equivalent of approximately 2.9 million shares) in exchange for the distribution of the interests in the entity which held that portion of the wilmorite portfolio that consisted of eastview mall, greece ridge center, marketplace mall and pittsford plaza, collectively referred to as the "rochester properties." this exchange is referred to as the "rochester redemption." on january 10, 2008, the company in a 50/50 joint venture, acquired the shops at north bridge, a 680,933 square foot urban shopping center in chicago, illinois, for a total purchase price of $515.0 million. the company's share of the purchase price was funded by the assumption of a pro rata share of the $205.0 million fixed rate mortgage on the center and by borrowings under the company's line of credit. 2 financing activity: on january 2, 2007, the company paid off the $75.0 million loan on paradise valley mall. the repayment was funded by the proceeds from the sale of citadel mall, northwest arkansas mall and crossroads mall on december 29, 2006. on january 23, 2007, the company exercised an earn-out provision under the loan agreement on valley river center and borrowed an additional $20.0 million at a fixed rate of 5.64%. the loan proceeds were used to pay down the company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes. on march 16, 2007, the company issued $950.0 million in convertible senior notes ("senior notes") that mature on march 15, 2012. the senior notes bear interest at 3.25%, payable semiannually, are senior unsecured debt of the company and are guaranteed by the operating partnership. the senior notes had an initial conversion price of $111.48. the proceeds were used to payoff the $250 million term loan, and to pay down the company's line of credit. (see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations--liquidity and capital resources"). in connection with the issuance of the senior notes, the company purchased two capped calls ("capped calls") from affiliates of the initial purchasers of the senior notes for approximately $59.9 million. the capped calls effectively increased the conversion price of the senior notes to approximately $130.06, which represented a 40% premium to the march 12, 2007 closing price of $92.90 per common share of the company. the capped calls are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon exchange of the senior notes in the event the market value per share of the company's common stock, as measured under the terms of the relevant settlement date, is greater than the strike price of the capped calls. on march 23, 2007, the company used borrowings under the line of credit to pay off the $51.0 million interest only loan on tucson la encantada. on

the property. the two existing loans on the property were replaced with a new $550.0 million loan bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.66% and maturing july 8, 2013. the company used its pro rata share of proceeds to pay down the company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes. redevelopment and development activity: the first phase of santan village regional center opened on

dining environment that will connect with the popular third street promenade. the santa monica place redevelopment has started and is moving forward with a projected fall 2009 completion. the shopping center industry general there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. community shopping centers, also referred to as "strip centers" or "urban villages" or "specialty centers", are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community shopping centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). anchors, mall and freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. 4 regional shopping centers a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and the preferred gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable growth in income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchor tenants are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gross leasable area contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a four-pronged business strategy which focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that are, or it believes can be, dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "recent developments--acquisitions and dispositions"). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and to be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. 5 on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages four malls for third party owners on a fee basis. in addition, the company manages four community centers for a related party. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "recent developments--redevelopment and development activity"). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "recent developments--redevelopment and development activity"). the centers as of december 31, 2007, the centers consist of 74 regional shopping centers and 20 community shopping centers aggregating approximately 80.7 million square feet of gla. the 74 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 991,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.2 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 323,455 square feet of gla at panorama mall. the company's 20 community shopping centers have an average of approximately 249,000 square feet of gla. after giving effect to the rochester redemption and the acquisition of the shops at north bridge (see recent developments), the centers presently include 318 anchors totaling approximately 41.6 million square feet of gla and approximately 9,200 mall and freestanding stores totaling approximately 35.1 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition, an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rent that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping and home shopping networks, factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its portfolio of centers. major tenants the centers derived approximately 95.1% of their total minimum rents for the year ended december 31, 2007 from mall and freestanding stores. one tenant accounted for approximately 3.3% 6 of minimum rents of the company, and no other single tenant accounted for more than 2.7% of minimum rents as of december 31, 2007. the following tenants (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the company's portfolio (including joint ventures) based upon minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2007: tenant primary dba's number of locations in the portfolio % of total annual minimum rents as of december 31, 2007(1) mervyn's(2) mervyn's 45 3.3 % the gap, inc. gap, banana republic, old navy 103 2.7 % limited brands, inc. victoria secret, bath and body 146 2.3 % foot locker, inc. footlocker, champs sports, lady footlocker 161 2.0 % at&amp;t mobility, llc(3) at&amp;t wireless, cingular wireless 33 1.5 % abercrombie &amp; fitch co. abercrombie &amp; fitch 71 1.5 % luxottica group s.p.a. lenscrafters, sunglass hut 150 1.2 % zale corporation zales, piercing pagoda, gordon's jewelers 120 1.2 % american eagle outfitters, inc. american eagle outfitters 57 1.0 % signet group kay jewelers, weisfield jewelers 76 1.0 % (1) the above table includes the shops at north bridge and excludes the rochester properties. (2) fee simple and/or ground leasehold interests in thirty-nine mervyn's stores were acquired on december 17, 2007. (3) includes at&amp;t mobility office headquarters located at redmond town center. mall and freestanding stores mall and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in some cases, tenants pay only percentage rents. historically, most leases for mall and freestanding stores contain provisions that allow the centers to recover their costs for maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. since january 2005, the company generally began entering into leases which require tenants to pay a stated amount for such operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the portfolio at december 31, 2007 comprises 69.1% of all mall and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity. the company believes that to include space over 10,000 square feet would provide a less meaningful comparison. when an existing lease expires, the company is often able to enter into a new lease with a higher base rent component. the average base rent for new mall and freestanding store leases at the consolidated centers, 10,000 square feet and under, commencing during 2007 was $43.23 per square foot, or 26.4% higher than the average base rent for all mall and freestanding stores at the consolidated centers, 10,000 square feet and under, expiring during 2007 of $34.21 per square foot. 7 the following table sets forth for the centers, the average base rent per square foot of mall and freestanding gla, for tenants 10,000 square feet and under, as of december 31 for each of the past three years: for the year ended december 31, average base rent per square foot(1) avg. base rent per sq. ft. on leases commencing during the year(2) avg. base rent per sq. ft. on leases expiring during the year(3) consolidated centers: 2007 $ 38.49 $ 43.23 $ 34.21 2006 $ 37.55 $ 38.40 $ 31.92 2005 $ 34.23 $ 35.60 $ 30.71 joint venture centers: 2007 $ 38.72 $ 47.12 $ 34.87 2006 $ 37.94 $ 41.43 $ 36.19 2005 $ 36.35 $ 39.08 $ 30.18 (1) average base rent per square foot is based on mall and freestanding store gla for spaces, 10,000 square feet and under occupied as of december 31 for each of the centers owned by the company. leases for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007. (2) the average base rent per square foot on lease signings commencing during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months, for tenants 10,000 square feet and under. lease signings for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for all tenant leases 10,000 square feet and under expiring during the year. leases for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007. 8 cost of occupancy the company's management believes that in order to maximize the company's operating cash flow, the centers' mall store tenants must be able to operate profitably. a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last three years: for years ended december 31, 2007 2006 2005 consolidated centers: minimum rents 8.0 % 8.1 % 8.3 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % expense

base rent. leases for santa monica place, currently under redevelopment, have been excluded. the rochester properties are excluded and the shops at north bridge are included in the above tables. anchors anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall and freestanding stores. each anchor, which owns its own store, and certain anchors which lease their stores, enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 4.9% of the company's total minimum rent for the year ended december 31, 2007. 10 the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such anchor or parent company in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2007, giving effect to the rochester redemption and the acquisition of

(8) the company is contemplating various replacement tenant and/or redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to a phase i audit (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these audits, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues that may reasonably result in costs associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental liability: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain of the centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain of the centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in earthquake-prone zones, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $106.6 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a 12 $10,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $10 million three-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2007, the company and the management companies employed 3,014 persons, including executive officers (11), personnel in the areas of acquisitions and business development (26), property management/marketing (489), leasing (200), redevelopment/development (81), financial services (281) and legal affairs (65). in addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the company generally maintains its own security and guest services staff (1,842) and in some cases maintenance staff (19). unions represent six of these employees. the company primarily engages a third party to handle maintenance at the centers. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. available information; website disclosure; corporate governance documents

factors we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including a recession); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws, and by interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing. in addition, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. furthermore, real estate investments are relative illiquid. this characteristic tends to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. some of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona and eight centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factor, or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition, an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping and home shopping networks, 14 factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect our revenues. our centers depend on tenants to generate rental revenues. our revenues and funds available for distribution will be reduced if: a significant number of our tenants are unable (due to poor operating results, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations; we are unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms; or for any other reason, we are unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. a decision by an anchor, or other significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other anchors and/or other tenants to terminate their leases, seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. the bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, or sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer, may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers decline sufficiently, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental 15 requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2007 was $7.6 billion (including $1.8 billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the cash flow available for other business opportunities. in addition, we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. a majority of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. each of the principals serves as an executive officer and is a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. 16 the guarantees of indebtedness by and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals have guaranteed mortgage loans encumbering one of the centers. as of december 31, 2007, the principals have guaranteed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $21.8 million. the existence of guarantees of these loans by the principals could result in the principals having interests that are inconsistent with the interests of our stockholders. the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. 17 in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, sell a portion of our investments (potentially at disadvantageous prices) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts for investments. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 42 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in centers that are not wholly owned centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some 18 non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of acms into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $106.6 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $10,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $10 million three-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on many of the centers for less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, the entity that owns the affected center could lose its capital invested in the center, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the center, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the center. an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact our financial condition. as the general partner of the operating partnership and certain of the property partnerships, we are generally liable for any of its unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include 19 some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all four principals). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. stockholder rights plan and selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. agreements to which we are a party, as well as some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these agreements and provisions include the following: a stockholder rights plan (which is generally triggered when an entity, group or person acquires 15% or more of our common stock), which, in the event of a takeover attempt not approved by our board of directors, allows our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock, or the common stock of the acquiring entity, at a 50% discount; a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors, which may make the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult; advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's shares) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from 20 these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a

interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table

rate swap agreements ("swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $11.5 million per year based on $1.1 billion outstanding of floating rate debt at december 31, 2007. the fair value of the company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskrisk factors 14 risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k/a, as well as our other reports filed with

december 17, 2007, the company purchased a portfolio of fee simple and/or ground leasehold interests in 39 freestanding mervyn's department stores located in the southwest united states for $400.2 million. the purchase price was funded by cash and borrowings under the company's line of credit. concurrent with the acquisition, the company entered into 39 individual agreements to leaseback the

collectively referred to as the "rochester properties." the company recognized a gain of $99.3 million on the exchange based on the difference between the fair value of the additional interest acquired in the non-rochester properties and the carrying value of the rochester properties, net of minority interest. this exchange is referred herein as the "rochester redemption." 2 on january 10, 2008, the company in a 50/50 joint venture, acquired the shops at north bridge, a 680,933 square foot urban shopping center in chicago, illinois, for a total purchase price of $515.0 million. the company's share of the purchase price was funded by the assumption of a pro rata share of the $205.0 million fixed rate mortgage on the center and by borrowings under the company's line of credit. financing activity: on january 2, 2007, the company paid off the $75.0 million loan on paradise valley mall. the repayment was funded by the proceeds from the sale of citadel mall, northwest arkansas mall and crossroads mall on december 29, 2006. on january 23, 2007, the company exercised an earn-out provision under the loan agreement on valley river center and borrowed an additional $20.0 million at a fixed rate of 5.64%. the loan proceeds were used to pay down the company's line of credit and for general corporate purposes. on march 16, 2007, the company issued $950.0 million in convertible senior notes ("senior notes") that mature on march 15, 2012. the senior notes bear interest at 3.25%, payable semiannually, are senior unsecured debt of the company and are guaranteed by the operating partnership. the senior notes had an initial conversion price of $111.48. the proceeds were used to payoff the $250 million term loan, and to pay down the company's line of credit.

purchased two capped calls ("capped calls") from affiliates of the initial purchasers of the senior notes for approximately $59.9 million. the capped calls effectively increased the conversion price of the senior notes to approximately $130.06, which represented a 40% premium to the march 12, 2007 closing price of $92.90 per common share of the company. the capped calls are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon exchange of the senior notes in the event the market value per share of the company's common stock, as measured under the terms of the relevant settlement date, is greater than the strike price of the capped calls. on march 23, 2007, the company used borrowings under the line of credit to pay off the $51.0 million interest only loan on tucson la encantada. on

redeveloped as an open-air shopping and dining environment that will connect with the popular third street promenade. the santa monica place redevelopment has started and is moving forward with a projected fall 2009 completion. the shopping center industry general there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. community shopping centers, also referred to as "strip centers" or "urban villages" or "specialty centers", are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community shopping centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are 4 located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). anchors, mall and freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and the preferred gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable growth in income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchor tenants are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gross leasable area contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a four-pronged business strategy which focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that are, or it believes can be, dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "recent developments--acquisitions and dispositions"). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and to be responsive to the needs of retailers. 5 similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages four malls for third party owners on a fee basis. in addition, the company manages four community centers for a related party. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "recent developments--redevelopment and development activity"). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "recent developments--redevelopment and development activity"). the centers as of december 31, 2007, the centers consist of 74 regional shopping centers and 20 community shopping centers aggregating approximately 80.7 million square feet of gla. the 74 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 991,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.2 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 323,455 square feet of gla at panorama mall. the company's 20 community shopping centers have an average of approximately 249,000 square feet of gla. after giving effect to the rochester redemption and the acquisition of the shops at north bridge (see recent developments), the centers presently include 318 anchors totaling approximately 41.6 million square feet of gla and approximately 9,200 mall and freestanding stores totaling approximately 35.1 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition, an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rent that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping and home shopping networks, factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its portfolio of centers. 6 major tenants the centers derived approximately 95.1% of their total minimum rents for the year ended december 31, 2007 from mall and freestanding stores. one tenant accounted for approximately 3.3% of minimum rents of the company, and no other single tenant accounted for more than 2.7% of minimum rents as of december 31, 2007. the following tenants (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the company's portfolio (including joint ventures) based upon minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2007: tenant primary dba's number of locations in the portfolio % of total annual minimum rents as of december 31, 2007(1) mervyn's(2) mervyn's 45 3.3 % the gap, inc. gap, banana republic, old navy 103 2.7 % limited brands, inc. victoria secret, bath and body 146 2.3 % foot locker, inc. footlocker, champs sports, lady footlocker 161 2.0 % at&amp;t mobility, llc(3) at&amp;t wireless, cingular wireless 33 1.5 % abercrombie &amp; fitch co. abercrombie &amp; fitch 71 1.5 % luxottica group s.p.a. lenscrafters, sunglass hut 150 1.2 % zale corporation zales, piercing pagoda, gordon's jewelers 120 1.2 % american eagle outfitters, inc. american eagle outfitters 57 1.0 % signet group kay jewelers, weisfield jewelers 76 1.0 % (1) the above table includes the shops at north bridge and excludes the rochester properties. (2) fee simple and/or ground leasehold interests in thirty-nine mervyn's stores were acquired on december 17, 2007. (3) includes at&amp;t mobility office headquarters located at redmond town center. mall and freestanding stores mall and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in some cases, tenants pay only percentage rents. historically, most leases for mall and freestanding stores contain provisions that allow the centers to recover their costs for maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. since january 2005, the company generally began entering into leases which require tenants to pay a stated amount for such operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the portfolio at december 31, 2007 comprises 69.1% of all mall and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity. the company believes that to include space over 10,000 square feet would provide a less meaningful comparison. when an existing lease expires, the company is often able to enter into a new lease with a higher base rent component. the average base rent for new mall and freestanding store leases at the consolidated centers, 10,000 square feet and under, commencing during 2007 was $43.23 per square foot, or 26.4% higher than the average base rent for all mall and freestanding stores at the consolidated centers, 10,000 square feet and under, expiring during 2007 of $34.21 per square foot. 7 the following table sets forth for the centers, the average base rent per square foot of mall and freestanding gla, for tenants 10,000 square feet and under, as of december 31 for each of the past three years: for the year ended december 31, average base rent per square foot(1) avg. base rent per sq. ft. on leases commencing during the year(2) avg. base rent per sq. ft. on leases expiring during the year(3) consolidated centers: 2007 $ 38.49 $ 43.23 $ 34.21 2006 $ 37.55 $ 38.40 $ 31.92 2005 $ 34.23 $ 35.60 $ 30.71 joint venture centers: 2007 $ 38.72 $ 47.12 $ 34.87 2006 $ 37.94 $ 41.43 $ 36.19 2005 $ 36.35 $ 39.08 $ 30.18 (1) average base rent per square foot is based on mall and freestanding store gla for spaces, 10,000 square feet and under occupied as of december 31 for each of the centers owned by the company. leases for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007. (2) the average base rent per square foot on lease signings commencing during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months, for tenants 10,000 square feet and under. lease signings for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007. (3) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for all tenant leases 10,000 square feet and under expiring during the year. leases for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007. 8 cost of occupancy the company's management believes that in order to maximize the company's operating cash flow, the centers' mall store tenants must be able to operate profitably. a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last three years: for years ended december 31, 2007 2006 2005 consolidated centers: minimum rents 8.0 % 8.1 % 8.3 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % expense

cash basis, for all tenant leases 10,000 square feet and under expiring during the year. currently, 53% of leases have provisions for future consumer price increases which are not reflected in ending base rent. leases for santa monica place, currently under redevelopment, have been excluded. the rochester properties are excluded and the shops at north bridge are included in the above tables. anchors anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall and freestanding stores. each anchor, which owns its own store, and certain anchors which lease their stores, enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 4.9% of the company's total minimum rent for the year ended december 31, 2007. 10 the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such anchor or parent company in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2007, giving effect to the rochester redemption and the acquisition of

(7) barneys new york is scheduled to open a 60,000 square foot store at scottsdale fashion square in 2009. (8) the company is contemplating various replacement tenant and/or redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to a phase i audit (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these audits, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues that may reasonably result in costs associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental liability: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain of the centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain of the centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in earthquake-prone zones, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $106.6 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a 12 $10,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $10 million three-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2007, the company and the management companies employed 3,014 persons, including executive officers (11), personnel in the areas of acquisitions and business development (26), property management/marketing (489), leasing (200), redevelopment/development (81), financial services (281) and legal affairs (65). in addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the company generally maintains its own security and guest services staff (1,842) and in some cases maintenance staff (19). unions represent six of these employees. the company primarily engages a third party to handle maintenance at the centers. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. available information; website disclosure; corporate governance documents

sarbanes-oxley act and it is included as exhibit 31 hereto. 13 item 1a. risk factors we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including a recession); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws, and by interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing. in addition, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. furthermore, real estate investments are relative illiquid. this characteristic tends to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. some of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona and eight centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factor, or other factors affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition, an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping and home shopping networks, 14 factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect our revenues. our centers depend on tenants to generate rental revenues. our revenues and funds available for distribution will be reduced if: a significant number of our tenants are unable (due to poor operating results, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations; we are unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms; or for any other reason, we are unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. a decision by an anchor, or other significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other anchors and/or other tenants to terminate their leases, seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. the bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, or sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer, may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers decline sufficiently, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental 15 requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2007 was $7.6 billion (including $1.8 billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the cash flow available for other business opportunities. in addition, we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. a majority of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. each of the principals serves as an executive officer and is a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. 16 the guarantees of indebtedness by and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals have guaranteed mortgage loans encumbering one of the centers. as of december 31, 2007, the principals have guaranteed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $21.8 million. the existence of guarantees of these loans by the principals could result in the principals having interests that are inconsistent with the interests of our stockholders. the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. 17 in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, sell a portion of our investments (potentially at disadvantageous prices) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts for investments. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 42 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in centers that are not wholly owned centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some 18 non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of acms into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $106.6 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $10,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $10 million three-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on many of the centers for less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, the entity that owns the affected center could lose its capital invested in the center, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the center, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the center. an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact our financial condition. as the general partner of the operating partnership and certain of the property partnerships, we are generally liable for any of its unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include 19 some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all four principals). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. stockholder rights plan and selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. agreements to which we are a party, as well as some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these agreements and provisions include the following: a stockholder rights plan (which is generally triggered when an entity, group or person acquires 15% or more of our common stock), which, in the event of a takeover attempt not approved by our board of directors, allows our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock, or the common stock of the acquiring entity, at a 50% discount; a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors, which may make the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult; advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's shares) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from 20 these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2007 concerning

floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements ("swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a

flows by approximately $11.5 million per year based on $1.1 billion outstanding of floating rate debt at december 31, 2007. the fair value of the company's long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. community shopping centers, also referred to as "strip centers" or "urban villages" or "specialty centers", are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community shopping centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). anchors, mall and freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and the preferred gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchor tenants are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. 5 table of contents business of the company strategy: the company has a four-pronged business strategy which focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that are, or it believes can be, dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "recent developments acquisitions and dispositions"). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and to be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages four malls for third party owners on a fee basis. in addition, the company manages three community centers for a related party. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). 6 table of contents the centers as of december 31, 2008, the centers consist of 72 regional shopping centers and 20 community shopping centers totaling approximately 76.0 million square feet of gla. the 72 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 952,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.2 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 323,505 square feet of gla at panorama mall. the company's 20 community shopping centers have an average of approximately 238,000 square feet of gla. as of december 31, 2008, the centers included 311 anchors totaling approximately 40.3 million square feet of gla and approximately 9,000 mall and freestanding stores totaling approximately 35.6 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition, an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rent that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping and home shopping networks, factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its portfolio of centers. major tenants the centers derived approximately 91.7% of their total minimum rents for the year ended december 31, 2008 from mall and freestanding stores. one tenant accounted for approximately 2.4% of minimum rents of the company, and no other single tenant accounted for more than 2.3% of minimum rents as of december 31, 2008. 7 table of contents the following tenants (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the company's portfolio (including joint ventures) based upon minimum rents in place as of december 31, 2008: tenant primary dba's number of locations in the portfolio % of total minimum rents(1) gap inc. gap, banana republic, old navy 97 2.4 % limited brands, inc. victoria secret, bath and body 137 2.3 % foot locker, inc. footlocker, champs sports, lady footlocker 145 1.8 % forever 21, inc. forever 21, xxi forever 43 1.6 % abercrombie &amp;

leases for the market at estrella falls and santa monica place were excluded for 2008 due to the centers being under redevelopment. cost of occupancy the company's management believes that in order to maximize the company's operating cash flow, the centers' mall store tenants must be able to operate profitably. a major factor contributing to 9 table of contents tenant profitability is cost of occupancy. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last three years: for years ended december 31, 2008

currently, 53% of leases have provisions for future consumer price increases which are not reflected in ending base rent. leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center, santan village regional center, market at estrella falls and santa monica place are currently under redevelopment and have been excluded. anchors anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall and freestanding stores. each anchor, which owns its own store, and certain anchors which lease their stores, enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 8.3% of the company's total minimum rent for the year ended december 31, 2008. 11 table of contents the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned

(7) the company is contemplating various replacement tenants and/or redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues that may reasonably result in costs associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental liability: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain of the centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain of the centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars) because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, further carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the 13 table of contents relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2008, the company and the management companies had approximately 3,000 regular and temporary employees, including executive officers (10), personnel in the areas of acquisitions and business development (44), property management/marketing (506), leasing (203), redevelopment/development (92), financial services (302) and legal affairs (66). in addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the company generally maintains its own security and guest services staff (1,760) and in some cases maintenance staff (17). unions represent twenty-two of these employees. the company primarily engages a third party to handle maintenance at the centers. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a discussion of the extent to which the company's business may be seasonal, see "item 7 management's

in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. these factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports. we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including the current recession and constrained capital and credit markets); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual profits); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. 15 table of contents current economic conditions, including recent volatility in the capital and credit markets, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. the united states is in the midst of an economic recession with the capital and credit markets experiencing extreme volatility and disruption. the current economic environment has been affected by dramatic declines in the stock and housing markets, increases in foreclosures, unemployment and living costs as well as limited access to credit. this deteriorating economic situation has impacted and is expected to continue to impact consumer spending levels, which adversely impacts the operating results of our tenants. if current levels of market volatility continue or worsen, our tenants may also have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations. these events could impact our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations due to poor operating results, lack of liquidity, bankruptcy or other reasons. our ability to lease space and negotiate rents at advantageous rates could also be adversely affected in this type of economic environment and more tenants may seek rent relief. any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. some of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona and eight centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. many of these states have been more adversely affected by weak economic and real estate conditions. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factors, or other factors continue to affect or affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping and home shopping networks, factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect our revenues. our centers depend on tenants to generate rental revenues. our revenues and funds available for distribution will be reduced if: a significant number of our tenants are unable (due to poor operating results, capital constraints, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations; we are unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms; or for any other reason, we are unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. a decision by an anchor, or other significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other anchors and/or other tenants to terminate their leases, seek rent relief and/or cease 16 table of contents operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. the bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, or sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer, may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers decline sufficiently, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. given current economic conditions, we believe there is an increased risk that store sales of anchors and/or tenants operating in our centers may decrease in future periods, which may negatively affect our anchors' and/or tenants' ability to satisfy their lease obligations and may increase the possibility of consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies of our tenants and/or closure of their stores. by way of example, in july 2008, mervyn's filed for bankruptcy protection and announced in october its plans to liquidate all merchandise, auction its store leases and wind down its business. we have 45 mervyn's stores in our portfolio. we own the ground leasehold and/or fee simple interest in 44 of those stores and the remaining store is owned by a third party but is located at one of our centers. (see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's overview and summary mervyn's"). our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and 17 table of contents authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we may be unable to sell properties quickly because real estate investments are relatively illiquid. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2008 was $8.0 billion (which includes $2.3 billion of unsecured debt and $2.0 billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt). assuming the closing of our current loan commitment, approximately $406 millon of such indebtedness matures in 2009 (excluding loans with extensions). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the cash flow available for other business opportunities. in addition, we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. a majority of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. current turmoil in the capital and credit markets has significantly limited access to debt and equity financing for many companies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any such refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. 18 table of contents inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals serve as an executive officer and each principal is a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be 19 table of contents materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, sell a portion of our investments (potentially at disadvantageous prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock, (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity and reduce amounts for investments. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 44 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in centers that are not wholly owned centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; 20 table of contents we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of acms into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total 21 table of contents insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all four principals). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: a staggered board of directors (which will be fully declassified in 2011) and limitations on the removal of directors, which may make the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult; advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; 22 table of contents the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 59 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2008 concerning the company's long

2.36% and 6.09%, respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities" (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities of the company's consolidated

noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements ("swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $18.1 million per year based on $1.8 billion outstanding of floating rate debt at december 31, 2008. the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 9 mortgage notes payable of the company's consolidated financial statements).risk factors 15 risk factors"

primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. community shopping centers, also referred to as "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers," are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community shopping centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores and freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. 4 table of contents regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and the preferred gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchor tenants are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "recent developments acquisitions and dispositions"). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and to be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. 5 table of contents on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages five malls and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). the centers as of december 31, 2009, the centers consist of 72 regional shopping centers and 14 community shopping centers totaling approximately 75 million square feet of gla. the 72 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 955,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.2 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 314,305 square feet of gla at panorama mall. the company's 14 community shopping centers have an average of approximately 276,000 square feet of gla. as of december 31, 2009, the centers included 300 anchors totaling approximately 39.4 million square feet of gla and approximately 8,500 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 35.2 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition, an anchor or a tenant. in addition, private equity firms compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rent that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its portfolio of centers. major tenants the centers derived approximately 79% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2009 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet. big box and anchor tenants accounted for 21.0% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2009. one tenant accounted for 6 table of contents approximately 2.5% of total rents of the company, and no other single tenant accounted for more than 2.4% of total rents as of december 31, 2009. the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest rent payers in the company's portfolio (including joint ventures) based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2009: tenant primary dba's number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents(1) gap inc. gap, banana republic, old navy 94 2.5 % limited brands, inc. victoria secret, bath and body 144 2.4 % forever 21, inc. forever 21, xxi forever 48 1.9 % foot locker, inc. footlocker, champs sports, lady footlocker 143 1.7 % abercrombie &amp; fitch co. abercrombie &amp; fitch, abercrombie, hollister 81 1.6 % at&amp;t mobility llc(2) at&amp;t wireless, cingular wireless 29 1.3 % luxottica group lenscrafters, sunglass hut 156 1.3 % american eagle outfitters, inc. american eagle outfitters 66 1.3 % macy's, inc. macy's, bloomingdale's 65 1.0 % signet group plc kay jewelers, weisfield jewelers 76 1.0 % (1) total rents include minimum rents and percentage rents. (2) includes at&amp;t mobility office headquarters located at redmond town center. mall stores and freestanding stores mall store and freestanding store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. in some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. historically, most leases for mall stores and freestanding stores contained provisions that allowed the centers to recover their costs for maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the center. since january 2005, the company generally began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for such operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the company actually incurs at any center. tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the portfolio at december 31, 2009 comprises 69.1% of all mall store and freestanding store space. the company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity. mall store and freestanding store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the company's other space. most of the non-anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. as a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. mall store and freestanding store space under 10,000 square feet is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. when an existing lease expires, the company is often able to enter into a new lease with a higher base rent component. the average base rent for new mall store and freestanding store leases at the consolidated centers, 10,000 square feet and under, executed during 2009 was $38.15 per square foot, or 11.9% higher than the average base rent for all mall stores and freestanding stores at the consolidated centers, 10,000 square feet and under, expiring during 2009 of $34.10 per square foot. 7 table of contents the following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the centers, as of december 31 for each of the past five years: i. mall stores and freestanding stores, gla under 10,000 square feet: for the years ended december 31, average base rent per square foot(1) avg. base rent per sq.ft. on leases executed during the year(2) avg. base rent per sq. ft. on leases expiring during the year(3) consolidated centers: 2009 $ 37.77 $ 38.15 $ 34.10 2008 $ 41.39 $ 42.70 $ 35.14 2007 $ 38.49 $ 43.23 $ 34.21 2006 $ 37.55 $ 38.40 $ 31.92 2005 $ 34.23 $ 35.60 $ 30.71 unconsolidated joint venture centers: 2009 $ 45.56 $ 43.52 $ 37.56 2008 $ 42.14 $ 49.74 $ 37.61 2007 $ 38.72 $ 47.12 $ 34.87 2006 $ 37.94 $ 41.43 $ 36.19 2005 $ 36.35 $ 39.08 $ 30.18 ii. big box and anchors: for the years ended december 31, average base rent per square foot(1) avg. base rent per sq.ft. on leases executed during the year(2) number of leases executed during the year avg. base rent per sq. ft. on leases expiring during the year(3) number of leases expiring during the year consolidated centers: 2009 $ 9.66 $ 10.13 19 $ 20.84 5 2008 $ 9.53 $ 11.44 26 $ 9.21 18 2007 $ 9.08 $ 18.51 17 $ 20.13 3 2006 $ 8.36 $ 13.06 15 $ 8.47 4 2005 $ 7.81 $ 10.70 18 $ 17.91 2 unconsolidated joint venture centers: 2009 $ 11.60 $ 31.73 16 $ 19.98 16 2008 $ 11.16 $ 14.38 14 $ 10.59 5 2007 $ 10.89 $ 18.21 13 $ 11.03 5 2006 $ 9.69 $ 15.90 14 $ 7.53 2 2005 $ 9.32 $ 20.17 11 $ 2.27 1 (1) average base rent per square foot is based on spaces occupied as of december 31 for each of the centers. the leases for tucson la encantada and the expansion area of queens center were excluded for 2005 because they were under redevelopment. the leases for promenade at casa grande, santan village power center and santan village regional center were excluded for 2007 and 2008 because they were under development. the leases for the market at estrella falls and santa monica place were excluded for 2008 and 2009 because they were under development and redevelopment, respectively.

2007 and 2008 because they were under development. the leases for the market at estrella falls and santa monica place were excluded for 2008 and 2009 because they were under development and redevelopment, respectively. cost of occupancy a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for years ended december 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 consolidated centers: minimum rents

shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor, that owns its own store, and certain anchors that lease their stores, enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 6.9% of the company's total minimum rent for the year ended december 31, 2009. 11 table of contents the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company

(7) burlington coat factory is scheduled to open an 83,232 square foot store at chula vista center in march 2010. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues that may reasonably result in costs associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental liability: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars) because they are either uninsurable or not economically 13 table of contents insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, further carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2009, the company and the management companies had 2,749 regular and temporary employees, including executive officers (9), personnel in the areas of acquisitions and business development (39), property management/marketing (419), leasing (133), redevelopment/development (98), financial services (286) and legal affairs (61). in addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the company generally maintains its own security and guest services staff (1,685) and in some cases maintenance staff (19). unions represent twenty-two of these employees. the company primarily engages a third party to handle maintenance at the centers. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a discussion of the extent to which the company's business may be seasonal, see "item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. these factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties, and we may update them in our future periodic reports. we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. for purposes of this "risk factor" section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including a continuation or worsening of the recent economic downturn and constrained capital and credit markets); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual profits); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. 15 table of contents a continuation or worsening of recent adverse economic conditions and disruptions in the capital and credit markets could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. the u.s. economy, the real estate industry as a whole, and the local markets in which our centers are located have in recent years experienced adverse economic conditions, resulting in an economic recession as well as disruptions in the capital and credit markets. these adverse economic conditions have caused dramatic declines in the stock and housing markets, increases in foreclosures, unemployment and living costs as well as limited access to credit, which have adversely impacted consumer spending levels and the operating results of our tenants. if these conditions continue or worsen, or if similar conditions occur in the future, our tenants may also have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations. these events could impact our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations due to poor operating results, lack of liquidity, bankruptcy or other reasons. our ability to lease space and negotiate rents at advantageous rates has been and, may continue to be, adversely affected in this type of economic environment, and more tenants may seek rent relief. any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. some of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona, and eight centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. many of these states have been more adversely affected by weak economic and real estate conditions than have other states. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factors, or other factors continue to affect or affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are six other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, factory outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect our revenues. our centers depend on tenants to generate rental revenues. our revenues and funds available for distribution will be reduced if: a significant number of our tenants are unable (due to poor operating results, capital constraints, bankruptcy, terrorist activities or other reasons) to meet their obligations; we are unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms; or for any other reason, we are unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments. 16 table of contents a decision by an anchor or other significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. the closing of an anchor or other significant tenant may allow other anchors and/or other tenants to terminate their leases, seek rent relief and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry. the bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, or sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer, may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income, or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers decline sufficiently due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. given current economic conditions, we believe there is an increased risk that store sales of anchors and/or tenants operating in our centers may decrease in future periods, which may negatively affect our anchors' and/or tenants' ability to satisfy their lease obligations and may increase the possibility of consolidations, dispositions or bankruptcies of our tenants and/or closure of their stores. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. 17 table of contents we may be unable to sell properties quickly because real estate investments are relatively illiquid. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2009 was $6.8 billion (which includes $1.3 billion of unsecured debt and $2.3 billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt). approximately $247.2 million of such indebtedness matures in 2010 (excluding loans with extensions and refinancing transactions that have recently closed). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the cash flow available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, a majority of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. recently, turmoil in the capital and credit markets has significantly limited access to debt and equity financing for many companies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any such refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. 18 table of contents inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals of the operating partnership serve as executive officers of us, and each principal is a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our 19 table of contents stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 47 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground-leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional 20 table of contents capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ("acms") into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or 21 table of contents in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all three principals). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might 22 table of contents believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: a staggered board of directors (which will be fully declassified in 2011) and limitations on the removal of directors, which may make the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult; advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and

are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. community shopping centers, also referred to as "strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers," are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community shopping centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in an open-air center and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores and freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchor tenants are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. 4 table of contents business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "recent developments acquisitions"). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and to be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages four malls and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). 5 table of contents the centers as of december 31, 2010, the centers consist of 71 regional shopping centers and 13 community shopping centers totaling approximately 73 million square feet of gla. the 71 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 942,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.0 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 314,177 square feet of gla at panorama mall. the company's 13 community shopping centers have an average of approximately 292,000 square feet of gla. as of december 31, 2010, the centers included 294 anchors totaling approximately 38.4 million square feet of gla and approximately 8,300 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 34.2 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants the centers derived approximately 79% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2010 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet. big box and anchor tenants accounted for 21% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2010. 6 table of contents the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest rent payers in the company's portfolio (including joint ventures and excluding valley view center) based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2010: tenant primary dba number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents(1) gap inc. gap, banana republic, old navy 87 2.6 % limited brands, inc. victoria secret, bath and body 135 2.4 % forever 21, inc. forever 21, xxi forever 46 2.0 % foot locker, inc. footlocker, champs sports, lady footlocker 131 1.6 % abercrombie &amp; fitch co. abercrombie &amp; fitch, abercrombie, hollister 75 1.5 % at&amp;t mobility llc(2) at&amp;t wireless, cingular wireless 29 1.4 % golden gate capital eddie bauer, express, j. jill 59 1.3 % luxottica group s.p.a. lenscrafters, sunglass hut 149 1.3 % american eagle outfitters, inc. american eagle outfitters 61 1.1 % macy's, inc. macy's, bloomingdale's 64 1.0 % (1) total rents include minimum rents and percentage rents.

(5) the leases for valley view center were excluded. cost of occupancy a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for years ended december 31, 2010(1) 2009 2008 2007 2006 consolidated centers: minimum rents 8.6 % 9.1 % 8.9 % 8.0 % 8.1 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(2) 4.4 % 4.7 % 4.4 % 3.8 % 3.7 % 13.4 % 14.2 % 13.7 % 12.2 % 12.2 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 9.1 % 9.4 % 8.2 % 7.3 % 7.2 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.6 % expense recoveries(2) 4.0 % 4.3 % 3.9 % 3.2 % 3.1 % 13.5 % 14.1 % 12.5 % 11.0 % 10.9 % (1) the cost of occupancy excludes valley view center.

in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 7.6% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2010. 11 table of contents the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned or

kohl's, two have been leased to burlington coat factory and the remaining 11 are vacant. the company is currently seeking various replacement tenants for these vacant sites. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars) because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, further carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a 13 table of contents deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2010, the company had approximately 2,658 regular and temporary employees, including executive officers (7), personnel in the areas of acquisitions and business development (48), property management/marketing (404), leasing (130), redevelopment/development (89), financial services (286) and legal affairs (63). in addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the company generally maintains its own security and guest services staff (1,613) and in some cases maintenance staff (18). unions represent twenty of these employees. the company primarily engages a third party to handle maintenance at the centers. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a discussion of the extent

statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. these factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties, and we may update them in our future periodic reports. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. for purposes of this "risk factor" section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including the continued impact of the severe economic recession that began in 2007); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. continued economic weakness from the severe economic recession that began in 2007 may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the u.s. economy is still experiencing weakness from the severe recession that began in 2007 and resulted in increased unemployment, the bankruptcy or weakened financial condition of a number of large retailers, decreased consumer spending, a decline in residential and commercial property values and reduced demand and rental rates for retail space. although the u.s. economy has improved, high levels of unemployment have persisted, and rental rates and valuations for retail space have not fully recovered to pre-recession levels and may not for a number of years. we may continue to experience downward pressure on the rental rates we are able to charge as leases signed prior to the recession expire, and tenants may declare bankruptcy, announce store closings or fail to meet their lease 16 table of contents obligations, any of which could adversely affect the value of our properties and our financial condition and results of operations. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona, and eight centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. many of these states have been more adversely affected by weak economic and real estate conditions than have other states. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factors, or other factors continue to affect or affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have gone out of business. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline sufficiently due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. 17 table of contents in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. given current economic conditions, there is an increased risk that anchors or other significant tenants will sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial 18 table of contents prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ("acms") into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on all of the centers for generally less than their full value. 19 table of contents if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2010 was $6.1 billion (which includes $607.0 million of unsecured debt and $2.2 billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt). approximately $465.0 million of such indebtedness matures in 2011 (excluding loans with extensions and refinancing transactions that have recently closed). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the cash flow available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, a majority of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. the credit markets experienced a severe dislocation during 2008 and 2009, which, for certain periods of time, resulted in the near unavailability of debt financing for even the most creditworthy borrowers. although the credit markets have recovered from this severe dislocation, there are a number of continuing effects, including a weakening of many traditional sources of debt financing 20 table of contents and changes in underwriting standards and terms. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any such refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers, and a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 46 joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground-leased to a property partnership that owns a joint venture center and several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of eight joint venture centers (northpark center, west acres center, eastland mall, granite run mall, lake square mall, northpark mall, south park mall and valley mall). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some 21 table of contents non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all three principals who serve as one of our executive officers and directors). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or 22 table of contents more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. 23 table of contents if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2010 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value ("fv") (dollars in thousands): for the years

center industry general: there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers," "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community shopping centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in an open-air center and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores and freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. 5 table of contents regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "recent developments acquisitions"). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages four regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment 6 table of contents professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "recent developments redevelopment and development activity"). the centers as of december 31, 2011, the centers consist of 65 regional shopping centers and 14 community shopping centers totaling approximately 66 million square feet of gla. the 65 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 923,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.1 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 314,000 square feet of gla at panorama mall. the company's 14 community shopping centers have an average of approximately 298,000 square feet of gla. as of december 31, 2011, the centers included 256 anchors totaling approximately 34.5 million square feet of gla and approximately 8,100 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 31.8 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants the centers derived approximately 79% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2011 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet. big box and anchor tenants accounted for 21% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2011. 7 table of contents the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest rent payers in the centers (excluding valley view center, which is under the control of a court appointed receiver) based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2011: tenant primary dbas number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents(1) limited brands, inc. victoria's secret, bath and body works, victoria's secret beauty, pink 118 2.4 % gap inc. the gap, old navy, banana republic, gap kids, gap body, baby gap, the gap outlet, athleta 80 2.3 % forever 21, inc. forever 21, xxi forever 40 1.9 % golden gate capital express, eddie bauer, j. jill, california pizza kitchen 78 1.9 % foot locker, inc. champs sports, foot locker, foot action usa, ccs, lady foot locker, kids foot locker 115 1.7 % abercrombie &amp; fitch co. abercrombie &amp; fitch, hollister, abercrombie 64 1.4 % luxottica group s.p.a. sunglass hut, lenscrafters, oakley, optical shop of aspen, pearle vision center, ilori, sunglass hut / watch station 133 1.3 % american eagle outfitters, inc. american eagle, aerie, 77kids 53 1.2 % nordstrom, inc. nordstrom, last chance, nordstrom rack, nordstrom spa 21 1.1 % at&amp;t mobility llc(2) at&amp;t, cingular wireless, at&amp;t experience store 30 1.1 % (1) total rents include minimum rents and percentage rents.

(5) the leases for valley view center were excluded because the center is under the control of a court appointed receiver. (6) the leases for the sdg acquisition properties were included as consolidated centers for the year ended december 31, 2011. these centers were included with unconsolidated joint venture centers for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007. cost of occupancy a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more capacity for the company to increase rents at 10 table of contents the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for years ended december 31, 2011(1)(2) 2010(1)(2) 2009(1) 2008(1) 2007(1) consolidated centers: minimum rents 8.2 % 8.6 % 9.1 % 8.9 % 8.0 % percentage rents 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % expense recoveries(3) 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.7 % 4.4 % 3.8 % 12.8 % 13.4 % 14.2 % 13.7 % 12.2 % unconsolidated joint venture centers: minimum rents 9.1 % 9.1 % 9.4 % 8.2 % 7.3 % percentage rents 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % expense recoveries(3) 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.3 % 3.9 % 3.2 % 13.4 % 13.5 % 14.1 % 12.5 % 11.0 % (1) the sdg acquisition properties were included in the consolidated centers for the year ended december 31, 2011 and were included in the unconsolidated joint venture centers for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. currently, 62% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. leases for the sdg acquisition properties are included in the consolidated centers. the leases for the shops at atlas park and south ridge mall were excluded as these properties are under redevelopment. anchors anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. anchors accounted for approximately 7.3% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2011. 13 table of contents the following table identifies each anchor, each parent company that owns multiple anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such anchor or parent company in the company's portfolio at december 31, 2011. anchors at valley view center are excluded from the table below because the center is under the control of a court appointed receiver.

(3) neiman marcus is scheduled to open an 88,000 square foot store at broadway plaza in march of 2012. (4) the company is currently seeking various replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. (5) the company owns a portfolio of 15 former mervyn's stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these 15 stores, five have been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to kohl's, one has been leased to burlington coat factory, one has been leased to cabela's, two have been leased for non-anchor usage and the remaining five former mervyn's locations are vacant. the company is currently seeking replacement tenants for these vacant sites. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars) because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, further carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the 15 table of contents relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2011, the company had approximately 1,377 employees, of which approximately 1,094 were full-time. unions represent five of these employees. the company believes that relations with its employees are good.

the macerich company 401 wilshire blvd., suite 700 santa monica, ca 90401 item 1a. risk factors the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. for purposes of this "risk factor" section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including the continued impact of the severe economic recession that began in 2007); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); 17 table of contents negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. continued economic weakness from the severe economic recession that began in 2007 may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the u.s. economy is still experiencing weakness from the severe recession that began in 2007 and resulted in increased unemployment, the bankruptcy or weakened financial condition of a number of large retailers, a decline in residential and commercial property values and reduced demand and rental rates for retail space. although the u.s. economy has improved, high levels of unemployment have persisted, and rental rates and valuations for retail space have not fully recovered to pre-recession levels and may not for a number of years. we may continue to experience downward pressure on the rental rates we are able to charge as leases signed prior to the recession expire, and tenants may declare bankruptcy, announce store closings or fail to meet their lease obligations, any of which could adversely affect the value of our properties and our financial condition and results of operations. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona, and eight centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. many of these states have been more adversely affected by weak economic and real estate conditions than have other states. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factors, or other factors continue to affect or affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are seven other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, outlet centers, discount shopping clubs and mail-order services that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates 18 table of contents at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have gone out of business. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. given current economic conditions, there is an increased risk that anchors or other significant tenants will sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. 19 table of contents our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ("acms") into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms. 20 table of contents uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $800 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2011 was $6.2 billion (which includes $852.8 million of unsecured debt and $1.9 billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt). approximately $737.0 million of such indebtedness (at our pro rata share), including $437.8 million of senior notes, matures in 2012 (excluding valley view center, prescott gateway and refinancing transactions that have recently closed). as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, a majority of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. 21 table of contents we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. the credit markets experienced a severe dislocation during 2008 and 2009, which, for certain periods of time, resulted in the near unavailability of debt financing for even the most creditworthy borrowers. although the credit markets have recovered from this severe dislocation, there are a number of continuing effects, including a weakening of many traditional sources of debt financing and changes in underwriting standards and terms. since the severe recession that began in 2007, the capital markets have also experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and disruption. while the capital markets have shown signs of improvement, the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. in addition, any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers, and a member of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 34 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we may have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties may share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on our status. for example, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; 22 table of contents we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. in addition, some of our outside partners control the day-to-day operations of two joint venture centers (northpark center and west acres center). we, therefore, do not control cash distributions from these centers, and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation. our percentage ownership interest in the equity of a joint venture vehicle may not reflect our economic interest in the joint venture center owned by the entity, since each joint venture has various agreements regarding cash flow, profits and losses, allocations, capital requirements, priority on return of capital, preferential returns to joint venture partners, incentive compensation for the joint venture manager and other matters. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all three principals who serve as one of our executive officers and directors). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. 23 table of contents our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 24 table of contents federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make 25 table of contents distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 61 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2011 concerning the company's long term debt

consolidated centers' total fixed rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was $2.6 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was 5.53% and 5.98%, respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.6 billion and $766.9 million, respectively. the average interest rate on floating rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was 3.09% and 3.85%, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was 5.92% and 6.11%, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was $161.2 million and 61 table of contents $241.7 million, respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2011 and 2010 was 3.88% and 2.24%, respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). the following derivative at december 31, 2011 was outstanding (amounts in thousands): property/entity notional amount product rate maturity company's ownership fair value westside pavilion 175,000 cap 5.50 % 6/5/2012 100 % interest rate cap agreements ("cap") offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements ("swap") effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $17.2 million per year based on $1.7 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2011. the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 10 mortgage notes payable and note 11 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements).risk factors 18 risk factors" of this annual report

there are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gla and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("anchors") and are referred to as "regional shopping centers" or "malls." regional shopping centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("mall stores"), most of which are national or regional 7 table of contents retailers typically located along corridors connecting the anchors. "strip centers," "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("community/power shopping centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. community/power shopping centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of gla. outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in an open-air center and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of gla. in addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("freestanding stores"). mall stores and freestanding stores over 10,000 square feet are also referred to as "big box." anchors, mall stores, freestanding stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. regional shopping centers: a regional shopping center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. regional shopping centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. regional shopping centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. this stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of regional shopping centers in their trade areas. regional shopping centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the mall stores. mall gla, which generally refers to gla contiguous to the anchors for tenants other than anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. mall stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a regional shopping center. business of the company strategy: the company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional shopping centers. acquisitions. the company principally focuses on well-located, quality regional shopping centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. in addition, the company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the company's portfolio such as outlet centers. the company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. since its initial public offering, the company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. the company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. (see "acquisitions and dispositions" in recent developments). leasing and management. the company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. for this reason, the company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. in addition, the company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. the 8 table of contents company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the center's trade area. the company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the centers. each center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the center. property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. similarly, the company generally utilizes on-site and regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a center is located. the company continually assesses and fine tunes each center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. on a selective basis, the company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. the company currently manages four regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. redevelopment. one of the major components of the company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. for this reason, the company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the centers. the redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals. (see "redevelopment and development" in recent developments). development. the company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. the company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. (see "redevelopment and development" in recent developments). the centers as of december 31, 2012, the centers consist of 61 regional shopping centers and nine community/power shopping centers totaling approximately 63 million square feet of gla. the 61 regional shopping centers in the company's portfolio average approximately 930,000 square feet of gla and range in size from 2.1 million square feet of gla at tysons corner center to 242,000 square feet of gla at tucson la encantada. the company's nine community/power shopping centers have an average of approximately 486,000 square feet of gla. as of december 31, 2012, the centers included 243 anchors totaling approximately 33.1 million square feet of gla and approximately 7,300 mall stores and freestanding stores totaling approximately 30.3 million square feet of gla. competition there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with the company in its trade areas. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the company for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with the company in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition for both the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the company's ability to lease 9 table of contents space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, outlet centers and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the company's revenues. in making leasing decisions, the company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. the company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its centers. major tenants the centers derived approximately 77% of their total rents for the year ended december 31, 2012 from mall stores and freestanding stores under 10,000 square feet. big box and anchor tenants accounted for 23% of total rents for the year ended december 31, 2012. the following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest rent payers in the centers based upon total rents in place as of december 31, 2012: tenant primary dbas number of locations in the portfolio % of total rents(1) gap, inc., the athleta, banana republic, the gap, gap kids, gap body, baby gap, the gap outlet, old navy 78 2.5 % limited brands, inc. bath and body works, victoria's secret, victoria's secret beauty, pink 116 2.5 % forever 21, inc. forever 21, xxi forever 41 2.2 % foot locker, inc. champs sports, ccs, foot locker, foot action usa, kids foot locker, lady foot locker 116 1.7 % luxottica group s.p.a. ilori, lenscrafters, oakley, optical shop of aspen, pearle vision center, sunglass hut / watch station 124 1.3 % abercrombie &amp;

(4) the average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. cost of occupancy a major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the company. tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. these tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. these tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. a low cost of occupancy percentage shows more capacity for the company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. the following table summarizes 12 table of contents occupancy costs for mall store and freestanding store tenants in the centers as a percentage of total mall store sales for the last five years: for years ended december 31, 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 consolidated centers: minimum rents 8.1 % 8.2 % 8.6 % 9.1 % 8.9 %

currently, 63% of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. the leases for the shops at atlas park and southridge mall were excluded as these properties are under redevelopment. anchors anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with regional shopping centers. anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. although the centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchors than from mall stores and freestanding stores, strong anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the centers desirable locations for mall store and freestanding store tenants. anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores and freestanding stores. each anchor that owns its own store and certain anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. 14 table of contents anchors accounted for approximately 8.5% of the company's total rents for the year ended december 31, 2012. the following table

(2) the company is currently seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. 15 table of contents (3) the company owns a portfolio of 14 stores located at shopping centers not owned by the company. of these 14 stores, four have been leased to forever 21, one has been leased to kohl's, one has been leased to burlington coat factory, one has been leased to cabela's, three have been leased for non-anchor usage and the remaining four locations are vacant. the company is currently seeking replacement tenants for these vacant sites. environmental matters each of the centers has been subjected to an environmental site assessment phase i (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. based on these assessments, and on other information, the company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: asbestos. the company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("acm") surveys at various locations within the centers. the surveys indicate that acms are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. the identified acms are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. at certain centers where acms are present or suspected, however, some acms have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("o&amp;m") plan to manage acms in place. underground storage tanks. underground storage tanks ("usts") are or were present at certain centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such centers. usts also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain centers. some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. chlorinated hydrocarbons. the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("pce") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. where pce has been detected, the company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. see "item 1a. risk factors possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." insurance each of the centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. the company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars) because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, further carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. the company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carries specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while the company or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance on the centers, the policies are subject to a 16 table of contents $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value. qualification as a real estate investment trust the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended december 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. as a reit, the company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. qualification and taxation as a reit depends on the company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the code. employees as of december 31, 2012, the company had approximately 1,368 employees, of which approximately 1,077 were full-time. the company believes that relations with its employees are good. seasonality for a discussion of the extent to which the company's business may be seasonal,

following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. this list should not be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties as it does not describe additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we do not currently consider material. we may update our risk factors from time to time in our future periodic reports. any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. risks related to our business and properties we invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. for purposes of this "risk factor" section, centers wholly owned by us are referred to as "wholly owned centers" and centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as "joint venture centers." a number of factors may decrease the income generated by the centers, including: the national economic climate (including the impact of continued weakness in the u.s. economy); the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities, other acts of violence and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a center; and increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. weakness in the u.s. economy may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the u.s. economy has continued to experience weakness from the severe recession that began in 2007. although the u.s. economy has improved, the rate of u.s. economic growth remains uncertain, high levels of unemployment persist and valuations for retail space have not fully recovered to pre-recession levels. if u.s. economic conditions remain weak or worsen, we may, as we did following the severe recession in 2007, experience downward pressure on the rental rates we are able to charge as leases signed prior to the recession expire, tenants may declare bankruptcy, announce store closings 18 table of contents or fail to meet their lease obligations and occupancy rates may decline, any of which could adversely affect the value of our properties and our financial condition and results of operations. a significant percentage of our centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. a significant percentage of our centers are located in california and arizona, and ten centers in the aggregate are located in new york, new jersey and connecticut. many of these states have been more adversely affected by weak economic and real estate conditions than have other states. to the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions, including as a result of the factors described in the preceding risk factors, or other factors continue to affect or affect california, arizona, new york, new jersey or connecticut (or their respective regions) more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are in a competitive business. there are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. there are eight other publicly traded mall companies in the united states and several large private mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against us for an acquisition of an anchor or a tenant. in addition, other reits, private real estate companies, and financial buyers compete with us in terms of acquisitions. this results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or anchors to occupy space. competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. the existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. there is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, internet shopping, home shopping networks, outlet centers and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect our revenues. we may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. if the rental rates at our centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. in recent years a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy or have gone out of business. we may be unable to re-let stores vacated as a result of voluntary closures or the bankruptcy of a tenant. furthermore, if the store sales of retailers operating at our centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of a default by a lessee, the affected center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. 19 table of contents in addition, anchors and/or tenants at one or more centers might terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. the sale of an anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. if u.s. economic conditions remain weak or worsen, there is also an increased risk that anchors or other significant tenants will sell stores operating in our centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. store closures by an anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center. our acquisition and real estate development strategies may not be successful. our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers. many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face competition for acquisitions primarily from other reits, as well as from private real estate companies and financial buyers. some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. if any of the above events occurs, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that limit our ability to sell assets. in addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a 20 table of contents lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the center. possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. in addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. laws exist that impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials ("acms") into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to acms. in connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. some of our centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our centers in california or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornados, as well as our centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. the occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. each of our centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. we do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. in addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in california, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these centers. we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the centers located in the pacific northwest and in the new madrid seismic zone. however, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these centers. while we or the relevant joint venture also carries terrorism insurance 21 table of contents on the centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss of $800 million. each center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $20 million five-year aggregate limit. some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. furthermore, we carry title insurance on all of the centers for generally less than their full value. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents; and an inability to receive reimbursement from our tenants for their share of certain operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. we have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. our total outstanding loan indebtedness at december 31, 2012 was $6.9 billion (which includes $800.0 million of unsecured debt and $1.6 billion of our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). approximately $498.0 million of such indebtedness (at our pro rata share) matures in 2013, after giving effect to refinancing transactions and loan commitments that occurred after december 31, 2012. as a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. in addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. furthermore, most of our centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. certain centers also have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. 22 table of contents we depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements. we depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. the credit markets experienced a severe dislocation during 2008 and 2009, which, for certain periods of time, resulted in the near unavailability of debt financing for even the most creditworthy borrowers. although the credit markets have recovered from this severe dislocation, there are a number of continuing effects, including a weakening of many traditional sources of debt financing and changes in underwriting standards and terms. following the severe recession that began in 2007, the capital markets also experienced significant volatility and disruption. while the capital markets have improved, additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. any debt refinancing could also impose more restrictive terms. in addition, the federal government's failure to increase the amount of debt that it is statutorily permitted to incur as needed to meet its future financial commitments or a downgrade in the debt rating on u.s. government securities could lead to a weakened u.s. dollar, rising interest rates and constrained access to capital, which could materially adversely affect the u.s. and global economies, increase our costs of borrowing and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. risks related to our organizational structure certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the operating partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. under the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the operating partnership's business and affairs. three of the principals of the operating partnership serve as our executive officers and as members of our board of directors. accordingly, these principals have substantial influence over our management and the management of the operating partnership. as a result, certain decisions concerning our operations or other matters affecting us may present conflicts of interest for these individuals. outside partners in joint venture centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. we own partial interests in property partnerships that own 27 joint venture centers as well as several development sites. we may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers. we have fiduciary responsibilities to our partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers. third parties in certain joint venture centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. in addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the joint venture centers if: we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; 23 table of contents we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the joint venture centers; or with respect to certain of the joint venture centers, if certain designated key employees no longer are employed in the designated positions. furthermore, certain joint venture centers have debt that could become recourse debt to us if the joint venture center is unable to discharge such debt obligation and, in certain circumstances, we may incur liability with respect to such debt greater than our legal ownership. our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. as a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the joint venture centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the operating partnership. because we conduct our operations through the operating partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the operating partnership and the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to us. under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act, the operating partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the operating partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the operating partnership. an inability to make cash distributions from the operating partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a reit. an ownership limit and certain anti-takeover defenses could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. the ownership limit. in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered "individuals") during the last half of a taxable year. our charter restricts ownership of more than 5% (the "ownership limit") of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions for some holders of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, and their respective families and affiliated entities, including all three principals who serve as one of our executive officers and directors). in addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a reit, the ownership limit may: have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders; and limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the ownership limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. 24 table of contents our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations) the ownership limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit. selected provisions of our charter and bylaws. some of the provisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. these provisions include the following: advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; the obligation of the directors to consider a variety of factors (in addition to maximizing stockholder value) with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; the authority of the directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and issue one or more series of common stock or preferred stock; the authority to create and issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities or property from us; and limitations on the amendment of our charter and bylaws, the dissolution or change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. selected provisions of maryland law. the maryland general corporation law prohibits business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder (which includes any person who beneficially holds 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding stock at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question) or its affiliates for five years following the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and, after the five-year period, requires the recommendation of the board of directors and two super-majority stockholder votes to approve a business combination unless the stockholders receive a minimum price determined by the statute. as permitted by maryland law, our charter exempts from these provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. maryland law also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. the maryland general corporation law also provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a maryland corporation (one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold, unless voting rights for the shares are approved by holders of two-thirds of the disinterested shares or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in our charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. our charter exempts from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. our bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that this bylaw will not be amended or eliminated in the future. the maryland general corporation law and our charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend our charter, dissolve, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 25 table of contents federal income tax risks the tax consequences of the sale of some of the centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. the principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the centers are sold. as a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. in addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of the operating partnership. if we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. we believe that we currently qualify as a reit. no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit structure like ours that holds assets in partnership form. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the joint venture centers, may affect our continued qualification as a reit. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the u.s. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a reit, we will suffer the following negative results: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. in addition, if we were to lose our reit status, we will be prohibited from qualifying as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. as a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. furthermore, the internal revenue service could challenge our reit status for past periods, which if successful could result in us owing a material amount of tax for prior periods. it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our reit election. even if we remain qualified as a reit, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. complying with reit requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. in order to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. we may also be required to make 26 table of contents distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. thus, compliance with reit requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. in addition, the reit provisions of the internal revenue code impose a 100% tax on income from "prohibited transactions." prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. this 100% tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered a prohibited transaction. complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. as a reit, we generally must distribute 90% of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. from time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90% of our taxable income as required by the reit rules. in that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders' election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the company) or find another alternative source of funds. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. in addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. tax legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us or our investors. in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to the u.s. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 61 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with appropriately matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on 61 table of contents anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. the following table sets forth information as of december 31, 2012 concerning the company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest

and 2011 was $3.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was 4.40% and 5.53%, respectively. the consolidated centers' total floating rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on floating rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was 3.05% and 3.09%, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' fixed rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. the average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was 5.27% and 5.92%, respectively. the company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture centers' floating rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was $178.3 million and $161.2 million, respectively. the average interest rate on such floating rate debt at december 31, 2012 and 2011 was 3.69% and 3.88%, respectively. the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value (see note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements). interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. as of december 31, 2012, the company did not have any interest rate cap or swap agreements in place. in addition, the company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $17.2 million per year based on $1.7 billion of floating rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2012. the fair value of the company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. in addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value 62 table of contents adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (see note 10 mortgage notes payable and note 11 bank and other notes payable in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements).
