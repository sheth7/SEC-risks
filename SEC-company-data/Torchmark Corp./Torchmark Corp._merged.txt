risk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. as our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and globe life direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical. in globe life direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer's disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks below. variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our operations, by limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only the rating agency's views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated 6 table of contents index to financial statements company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies' judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via globe life direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to unsolicited globe life direct response marketing could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: the health insurance market is subject to substantial legislative scrutiny. legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. competition in the health market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products. an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer, and other factors beyond our control. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant 7 table of contents index to financial statements unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the write downs of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the write downs, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. declines in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity also include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain 8 table of contents index to financial statements the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority's interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 has established a federal insurance office (fio) within the 9 table of contents index to financial statements department of the treasury, and the affordable care act and a financial stability oversight council (fsoc) created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio, fsoc and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability, and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. 10 table of contents index to financial statements catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity, caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. information security and technology risk: a security breach, the introduction of malware in our computing environment, employee error or malfeasance, unauthorized access, a natural or man-made disaster, or other unanticipated event could compromise the information security systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries, and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. a failure in our information security systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, loss of cash flow and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively. in some cases we may not become aware of such incident for some time after it occurs, which could increase our exposure. anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could access, view, misappropriate, alter or delete confidential information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is found under the heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 of this report. 47 table of contents index to financial statementsrisk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many public and private companies. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. as our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts of life policies sold are lower than those of policies sold in the

accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our

rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, two of which are labor union members and sales via globe life direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny. regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. competition in the health insurance market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products. obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability and thus our results of operations and financial condition. information security and technology risks: the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise secure data thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. our business operations are highly dependent upon information technology systems to provide efficient and resilient business operations. malicious actors, employee errors or disasters affecting these information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance and financial condition. to the extent our information systems may be breached by malicious actors, employee malfeasance or technological attacks, an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to alter or delete customer or proprietary information from our systems. in addition, we may not become aware of sophisticated or advanced cyber attacks for some time after they occur, thereby increasing the company's exposure. employee errors in the handling of our information or technology systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information technology systems to efficiently support business operations. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of their confidential information. any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the 7 table of contents index to financial statements marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, or require us to incur significant technical, legal or other expenses. in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. a disaster or natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, terror attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time, affecting our systems, physical business operations, and financial condition. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. as discussed above in information security and technology risks, the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades and changes in market values. our investment portfolio consists, almost exclusively, of fixed maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control. additionally, as the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required. changes in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to earn an excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our bond portfolio to decline. a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate bonds if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. in such a case, realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income and results of operations. 8 table of contents index to financial statements liquidity risks: our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their state of domicile . accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities, their profitability, and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should treasury rates increase or credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. in addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability and cost of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. as a result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected. 9 table of contents index to financial statements regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing of agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of such laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities and/or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. such actions could result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority's interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 established a federal insurance office (fio) within the department of the treasury, and the affordable care act and a financial stability oversight council (fsoc) created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio, fsoc and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability, and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners' statutory accounting practices (naic sap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. 10 table of contents index to financial statements non-compliance with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity, caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. 11 table of contents index to financial statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is found under the heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 of this report. 48 table of contents index to financial statementsrisk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many public and private companies. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the industry, each of which has its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higher-income markets. compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and motivates producing agents to increase sales is also critical. in globe life direct response, continuous development of new methods of reaching the consumer and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we primarily serve the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer's disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer or stop payment of insurance premiums altogether. economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks below. variations in expected-to-actual rates of mortality, morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity and persistency, as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could result in increased policy obligations and negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of capital. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations by limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, or impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only the rating agency's views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models 6 tmk 2017 form 10-k table of contents could impact the rating agencies' judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, two of which are labor unions and sales via globe life direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business. health insurance marketplace risks: the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny. regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our health insurance business. competition in the health insurance market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products. obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance, including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased, is highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business, financial condition and results of operations. information security and technology risks: the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise secure data thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. our business operations are highly dependent upon information technology systems to provide efficient and resilient business operations. malicious actors, employee errors or disasters affecting these information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance and financial condition. to the extent our information systems may be breached by malicious actors, employee malfeasance or technological attacks, an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to access, alter or delete customer or proprietary information from our systems or to render our systems unavailable for business use. additionally, we may not become aware of sophisticated cyber attacks for some time after they occur, thereby increasing the company's exposure. we may have to incur significant costs to address or remediate interruptions, threats and vulnerabilities in our information and technology systems and to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements related thereto. these risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase. employee errors in the handling of our information or technology systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information technology systems to efficiently support business operations. 7 tmk 2017 form 10-k table of contents additionally, we anticipate more frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks along with more impactful regulatory oversight models. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of their confidential information. any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, or require us to incur significant technical, legal or other expenses. in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees, agents or customers for a period of time. a disaster or natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, terrorist attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and existing contingency plans cannot function as designed. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. as discussed above in information security and technology risks , the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades and changes in market values. our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and short-term investments issued by corporations, where we are exposed to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on an investment. the concentration of these investments in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic areas increases this risk. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels (consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread), financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control. additionally, as the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required. changes in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to earn an excess investment income spread, we can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. 8 tmk 2017 form 10-k table of contents increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our bond portfolio to decline. a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate bonds if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. in such a case, realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income and results of operations. liquidity risks: our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing and reinsurance. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow

insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile . accordingly, impairments in assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in laws or regulations could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of our health premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities, their profitability, and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should interest rates rise in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced. in addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability and cost of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity were to decrease due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital,

turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal, tax or financial consequences. a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors. although we believe we have properly classified such individuals, a risk nevertheless exists that a court, the irs or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees. the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations, which we cannot predict. if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities, employee benefits, wage payments, fines, judgments and/or legal settlements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries' business models. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. 11 tmk 2017 form 10-k table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is found under the heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 of this report. 49 tmk 2017 form 10-k table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many public and private companies. we operate in the industry's life and health insurance sectors, each of which has its own set of risks. operational risks: the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higher-income markets. compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and motivates producing agents to increase sales is also critical. globe life direct response is continuously developing new methods of reaching consumers and realizing cost efficiencies. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we primarily serve the lower-middle to middle-income market for individual life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer's disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer or stop payment of insurance premiums altogether. economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks below. variations in expected-to-actual rates of mortality, morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity and persistency, as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of policyholder benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could result in increased policy obligations and negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer's ability to fulfill its contractual obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of capital. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. such an event could limit our access to capital markets, increase the cost of debt, or impair our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only a rating agency's views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated 6 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents company's control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact a rating agency's judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life insurance products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, two of which are labor unions and sales via globe life direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business. health insurance marketplace risks: the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny. regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health business. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our health insurance business. competition in the health insurance market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products. obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance, including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased, is highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, our medicare supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. since medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business, financial condition and results of operations. information security and technology risks: the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise data security, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. our business is highly dependent upon information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner. we gather and maintain data on our information systems, including the identity, health and financial information of our current, former and prospective policyholders, for the purpose of conducting marketing, sales and policy administration functions. this information is highly targeted by malicious threat actors. malicious threat actors, employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance and financial condition. an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to access, alter or delete data from our systems or to render our systems unavailable for business use. additionally, we may not become aware of sophisticated cyber-attacks for some time after they occur, thereby increasing the company's exposure. we may have to incur significant costs to address existing and future regulatory requirements related thereto. these risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase. 7 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents employee or agent errors in the handling of our information systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations. we may utilize the services of third parties in order to conduct our business. cyber events affecting these third parties could materially impact our sales and operational efficiency. we anticipate more frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks along with more impactful regulatory oversight models. an increasing number of states also require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of their confidential information. any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, or require us to incur significant technical, legal or other expenses. in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees, agents or customers for a period of time. a disaster or natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, terrorist attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and existing contingency plans cannot function as designed. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. as discussed above in information security and technology risks , the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades and changes in market values. our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and short-term investments, where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments. the concentration of these investments in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic areas increases this risk. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels (consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread), financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control. additionally, as the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss could be unrecoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss would be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades of the company by rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries, and/or higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required. 8 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents changes in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities. we attempt to manage our investments to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting the discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities. there is a risk that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will prevent us from doing so, thereby having a negative impact on income. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our fixed maturity portfolio to decline. a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash, thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. in such a case, realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income, consolidated rbc ratio and results of operations. liquidity risks: our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing and reinsurance. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile . accordingly, impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of our health insurance premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities, their profitability, and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should interest rates rise in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced. in addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of 9 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents our business activity were to decrease due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. if so, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders, not investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, agent licensing, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting the company may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should regulatory changes occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of such laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities and/or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents, are improper. such actions could result in substantial fines, penalties and/or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact our profitability. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 established a federal insurance office (fio), charged with monitoring systemic risk exposure in all lines of insurance other than health insurance and long-term care insurance, and a financial stability oversight council (fsoc), which serves to identify and respond to risks and emerging threats to u.s. financial systems. a center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), established under the department of health and human services, is charged with overseeing implementation of the affordable care act (aca). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the ongoing operations of the fio, fsoc and cciio, as well as any other proposals or executive action for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products insurers offer, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital, or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners' statutory accounting practices (naic sap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by 10 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents recognized authoritative bodies. future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. non-compliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security, including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality, could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba), the health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech), and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts involving the insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents and other matters have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal, tax or financial consequences. a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors. although we believe we have properly classified such individuals, a risk nevertheless exists that a court, the irs or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees. the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations, which we cannot predict. if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities, employee benefits, wage payments, fines, judgments and/or legal settlements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries' business models. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a 11 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. 12 tmk 2018 form 10-k table of contents quantitative and qualitative

business and results of operations. we primarily serve the lower middle-income to middle-income market for individual life and supplemental health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer's disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant,

these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our

withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life insurance products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches, two of which are labor unions and sales via direct to consumer solicitations. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public's receptivity to direct to consumer marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business. supplemental health insurance marketplace risks: the supplemental health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny. regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health business. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our supplemental health insurance business. competition in the health insurance market can be significant. sales of our supplemental health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare

highly dependent upon the internet, third-party service providers, and information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner. we gather and maintain data for the purpose of conducting marketing, actuarial analysis, sales and policy administration functions. our information systems may be vulnerable to disruption from physical or electronic attacks by malicious third-parties which could render our systems inaccessible for business use for a period of time. additionally, we may not become aware of sophisticated cyber-attacks for some time after they occur, thereby potentially increasing the data subject to loss. these risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase. malicious third-parties, employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations, regulatory compliance and financial condition. employee or agent errors in the handling of our information systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information, or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations. disasters, terrorist attacks, or war could cause our information or system availability to be inaccessible for business use for a period of time. 8 gl 2019 form 10-k more frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks and more impactful regulatory oversight models could result in additional costs to protect against security breaches. any breach of confidential information systems resulting from the above factors could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter potential customers from purchasing our products, result in the loss of existing customers, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, constrain cash flows, or require us to incur significant technical, legal or other expenses. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of globe life or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity through traditional media, internet, social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products and the persistency of in-force policies. as discussed in information security and technology risks , the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades and changes in market values. our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and short-term investments, where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments. a concentration of these investments in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic areas could increase this risk. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels (consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread), financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control. additionally, as the majority of our investments are long-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, a significant increase in interest rates or a market downturn could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders' equity. it is possible our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a default event and a portion or all of that unrealized loss could be unrecoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss would be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all. significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios, leading to potential downgrades of the company by rating agencies, potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries, and/or higher financing costs at the parent company should additional statutory capital be required. changes in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities, which could have a negative impact on income. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower interest rates. a rise in interest rates could result in certain policyholders surrendering their life, health or annuity policies for cash, thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations. in such a case, realized losses could result from the sale of the invested assets and could adversely affect our statutory income, consolidated rbc ratio and results of operations. 9 gl 2019 form 10-k liquidity risks: our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on available funds from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing and reinsurance. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries' liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile. accordingly, impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries' operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends, a principal source of our cash flow, to us. changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to pay our debt obligations, corporate expenses, or dividends on our capital stock. additionally, if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of supplemental health insurance premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities, their profitability, and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should interest rates rise in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced. in addition, if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions could limit our ability to replace maturing debt obligations in a timely manner or at all and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. if so, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders, not investors. regulatory agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions included in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, agent licensing, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, 10 gl 2019 form 10-k reserves and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting our companies may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should regulatory changes occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of such laws and regulations. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities and/or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents, are improper. such actions could result in substantial fines, penalties and/or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact our profitability. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products insurers offer, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' capital, or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners' statutory accounting practices (naic sap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. (refer to note 1 significant accounting policies under the caption a ccounting pronouncements yet to be adopted ) further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. non-compliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security, including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality, could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba), the health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech), and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business, and injunctive relief. 11 gl 2019 form 10-k litigation risks: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts involving insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents and other matters have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for an unpredictable material adverse judgment in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from such litigation. substantial legal liability in these pending or future legal actions could also have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal, tax or financial consequences. a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors. although we believe we have properly classified such individuals, a risk nevertheless exists that a court, the internal revenue service or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees. the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations, which we cannot predict. if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities, employee benefits, wage payments, fines, judgments and/or legal settlements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries' business models. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic, hurricane, earthquake, or man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or war, which may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. 12 gl 2019

the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. life insurance marketplace risk: the life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit torchmark ability to gain or maintain market share. competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry, but is less so in torchmark life insurance niche markets. in recent years, most life insurers have targeted the smaller, highly competitive, higher-income market by offering asset accumulation products. torchmark market has remained the middle income market, offering individually-sold protection life insurance, which is less competitive because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income, asset accumulation marketplace. 5 table of contents torchmark life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic conditions. because torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance, competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer disposable income. in times of economic downturns that affect employment levels, potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums. torchmark life products are sold in selected niche markets. the company is at risk should any of these markets diminish. torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches; labor union members and military officers. while both of these markets are known to have strong sales affinity, the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. in addition, because the military-focused agency is independent and uses other life insurance underwriters in addition to torchmark, torchmark has little control over marketing strategies of that agency, which could result in less-than favorable sales results for torchmark. the development and maintenance of torchmark various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales. because the company life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market is critical. for agents, adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities, and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits. health insurance marketplace risk: congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact torchmark medicare supplement business. medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of torchmark in force health insurance business. because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress from time to time. these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business. torchmark medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior - aged health care industry that provide alternative traditional medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other managed care or private plans. the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance. torchmark medicare supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales. in recent years, price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new sales in order to gain market share in the short term. torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. should these industry practices continue, it is likely that torchmark sales of this health product will remain depressed. torchmark health business is at risk in the event of government-sponsored under-age-65 health insurance. currently, torchmark leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65. these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees. if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65, demand for this product would likely decline. given the high cost and political challenges of such a program, torchmark believes this is a low-level risk in the foreseeable future. 6 table of contents changes in mortality, economic conditions, or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability. the company insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality, morbidity, persistency, and healthcare utilization that we experience. the resulting levels that occur may be significantly different from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income. however, the company actuaries continually test expected to actual results. torchmark ability to pay dividends or service any of its debt or preferred securities is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company. torchmark insurance company subsidiaries, its principal sources of cash flow, periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common stock and preferred stock held by torchmark, the holding company. torchmark ability to pay dividends on its common stock, principal and interest on any debt security, or dividends on any preferred stock security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends. the insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company. for example, under certain state insurance laws, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations, excluding capital gains and losses, or 10% of statutory surplus without regulatory approval. torchmark can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to torchmark by its subsidiaries. additionally, the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the profitability, and thus the ability of torchmark insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends. a ratings downgrade could negatively affect torchmark ability to compete. ratings are an important factor in torchmark competitive position. rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including the company insurance subsidiaries. while ratings are less important in the middle-income market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market, a downgrade in the ratings of torchmark insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products. rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the considered factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the company control. investment risk: the company investments are subject to market risks. torchmark invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults and changes in market values. factors that may affect the default rates and market values of invested assets include interest rate levels, financial market performance, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses of individual issuers. significant increases in interest rates could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio, reflecting unrealized fair value losses. this risk is mitigated by torchmark operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the long-term nature of its offsetting life policy reserve liabilities and by torchmark strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity. individual investments are also subject to impairment and write-down, due to adverse factors affecting that investment particular issuer, business, or industry. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the crediting rates paid on outstanding policies. while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. 7 table of contents significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in the company investment income as reinvestment of these proceeds would be at the prevailing lower rates. regulatory risk: regulatory changes could adversely affect our business. insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business. state agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business, which may include premium rates, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, and permitted investments. government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders. insurance laws, regulations, and policies currently affecting torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on its business. furthermore, the company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives. changes in taxation could negatively affect our income. changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates could increase the company tax burden and negatively affect its income. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states, including alabama, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. torchmark, like other insurers, is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. natural disaster risk: torchmark business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event. the marketplaces of torchmark major subsidiaries are national in scope for all but one, which is multi-state. because the company insurance policies in force are relatively low-face amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders, the likelihood that a large portion of the company policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is further diluted. as a result, it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark markets. in addition, the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan back-up administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster. the company also has outside contracts for off-site backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is found under the heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 beginning on page 32 of this report.

adversely affect sales. in recent years, labor union membership has grown little and has declined as a percentage of employed workers; however, torchmark union-member policyholders are still a small portion of total union membership, indicating that sales growth can continue for some time without growth in total union membership. most of the company direct response business is either through direct mail solicitation or inserted into other mail media for distribution. significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business. the development and maintenance of torchmark various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales. because the company life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing

increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future. these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business. in 2006, congress first provided prescription drug coverage (medicare part d) to medicare beneficiaries. changes are likely to be made to the program over the next several years as the acceptance and costs of the program become clear. some of these changes might adversely affect torchmark ability to profit from its sale or the level of risk involved. torchmark medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior -

substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states, including alabama, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. torchmark, like other insurers, is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. natural disaster risk: torchmark business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event. the marketplaces of torchmark major subsidiaries are national in scope. because the company insurance policies in force are relatively low-face amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders, the likelihood that a large portion of the company policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is not likely. as a result, it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark markets. in addition, the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan back-up administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster. the company also has outside contracts for off-site backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is found under the heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 beginning on page 36 of this report. 48 table of contentsrisk factors product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a mature, regulated industry, populated by many firms. torchmark operates in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. life insurance marketplace risk: the life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit torchmark ability to gain or maintain market share. competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry, but is less so in torchmark life insurance niche markets. in recent years, most life insurers have targeted the smaller, highly competitive, higher-income market by offering asset accumulation products. torchmark market has remained the middle income market, offering individually-sold protection life insurance, which is less competitive because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income, asset accumulation marketplace. 5 table of contents index to financial statements torchmark life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic conditions. because torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance, competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer disposable income. in times of economic downturns that affect employment levels, potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums. torchmark life products are sold in selected niche markets. the company is at risk should any of these markets diminish. torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response distribution. the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. in recent years, labor union membership has grown little and has declined as a percentage of employed workers; however, torchmark union-member policyholders are still a small portion of total union membership, indicating that sales growth can continue for some time without growth in total union membership. most of the company direct response business is either through direct mail solicitation or inserted into other mail media for distribution. significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business. the development and maintenance of torchmark various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales. because the company life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. for agents, adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities, and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits. health insurance marketplace risk: congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact torchmark medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business. medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of torchmark in force health insurance business. because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future. these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business. in 2006, congress first provided prescription drug coverage (medicare part d) to medicare beneficiaries. changes are likely to be made to the program over the next several years as the acceptance and costs of the program become clear. some of these changes might adversely affect torchmark ability to profit from its medicare part d sales or the level of risk involved. torchmark medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior - aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other managed care or private plans. the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance. torchmark medicare supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales. in recent years, price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new sales in order to gain market share. torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. should these industry practices continue, it is likely that torchmark sales of this health product will remain depressed. torchmark health business is at risk in the event of government-sponsored under-age-65 health insurance. currently, torchmark leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65. these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their 6 table of contents index to financial statements employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees. if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65, demand for this product would likely decline. however, any government plan might provide beneficial opportunities if the plan includes the insurance industry as providers. given the high cost and political challenges of such a program, torchmark believes this is a low-level risk in the foreseeable future. general operating risk: changes in mortality, economic conditions, or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability. the company insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality, morbidity, persistency, and healthcare utilization that we experience. the resulting levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income. however, the company actuaries continually test expected to actual results. torchmark ability to pay dividends or service any of its debt or preferred securities is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company. torchmark insurance company subsidiaries, its principal sources of cash flow, periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common and preferred stock held by torchmark, the holding company. torchmark ability to pay dividends on its common stock, principal and interest on any debt security, or dividends on any preferred stock security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends. the insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company. for example, under certain state insurance laws, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations, excluding capital gains and losses, or 10% of statutory surplus without regulatory approval. torchmark can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to torchmark by its subsidiaries. additionally, the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the profitability, and thus the ability of torchmark insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends. a ratings downgrade could negatively affect torchmark ability to compete. ratings are a factor in torchmark competitive position. rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including the company insurance subsidiaries. while ratings are less important in the middle-income market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market, a downgrade in the ratings of torchmark insurance subsidiaries could slightly affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products. rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the considered factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the company control. investment risk: the company investments are subject to market risks. torchmark invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. factors that may affect these risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of individual issuers. some of these factors could result in write-downs of individual investments. significant increases in interest rates could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio, reflecting unrealized fair value losses. this risk is mitigated by torchmark operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the long-term nature of the life policy reserve liabilities supported by investments and by torchmark strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity. 7 table of contents index to financial statements a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities. while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in the company investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. regulatory risk: regulatory changes could adversely affect our business. insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business. state agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business, which may include premium rates, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, and permitted investments. government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders. insurance laws, regulations, and policies currently affecting torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on its business. furthermore, the company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives. changes in taxation could negatively affect our income. changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates could increase the company tax burden and negatively affect its income. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states, including alabama and mississippi, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. torchmark, like other insurers, is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. natural disaster risk: torchmark business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event. the marketplaces of torchmark major subsidiaries are national in scope. because the company insurance policies in force are relatively low-face amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders throughout the country, the likelihood that a large portion of the company policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is not likely. as a result, it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark markets. in addition, the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan back-up administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster. the company also has outside contracts for off-site backup information systems and

65, demand for this product would likely decline. however, any government plan might provide beneficial opportunities if the plan includes the insurance industry as providers. variable annuity marketplace risk: our variable annuity business is at risk should equity markets decline. revenues and underwriting income for variable annuities are based on policyholder account values which consist of investments primarily in equity markets. when equity markets decline, not only would revenues be expected to decline, but we would generally expect redemptions to increase, further negatively affecting revenues and underwriting income. as a part of this business, we also guarantee a minimum death benefit to policyholders to be paid regardless of account size upon death. because of this benefit, our obligation costs rise as the account balance declines. additionally, the decline in policyholder account size will require us to adjust our actuarial assumptions on this business to take into account the lower revenues. as a result, these revisions in assumptions will generally negatively impact our underwriting income. variable annuities are not a significant part of our business and we no longer offer new variable annuity products. general operating risk: changes in mortality, economic conditions, or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability. the company insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality, morbidity, persistency, and healthcare utilization that we experience. the resulting levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income. however, the company actuaries

periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including the company insurance subsidiaries. while ratings are less important in the middle-income market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market, downgrades in the ratings of torchmark insurance subsidiaries could slightly affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products. liquidity risk: torchmark ability to pay dividends, service any of its debt or preferred securities, or meet its other operating commitments is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company. torchmark insurance company subsidiaries, its principal sources of cash flow, periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common and preferred stock held by torchmark, the

rates or widening of credit spreads could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio, reflecting unrealized fair value losses. this risk is mitigated by torchmark operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the long-term nature of the life policy reserve liabilities supported by investments and by torchmark strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity. a severe down turn in economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults and writedowns in our fixed maturity portfolio, which could possibly restrict the capital structure of our insurance subsidiaries and limit their ability to pay dividends. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities. while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in

heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 beginning on page 42 of this report. 54 table of contents index to financial statementsrisk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a mature, regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation. adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical, as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time. increased competition has led to a reduction in agents in our united american branch office agency and united american independent agency, which have historically been our major health distribution channels. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, persistency, and healthcare utilization could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, persistency, and healthcare utilization, as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products, our ability to market these products and our competitive position. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products; adversely affecting relationships with distributors and sales agents; increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals of funds; requiring a reduction in prices for our insurance products in order to remain competitive; and a lowering of our credit ratings. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an 6 table of contents announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only the rating agency views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response distribution. the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. in recent years, labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers. most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by insertion into other mail media for distribution. significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business. medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our in-force health insurance business. because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future. the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other managed care or private plans. the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance. our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales. in recent years, price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market, as well as the market for other health products, has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we have elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. should these industry practices continue, it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed. our health insurance business is at risk in the event of government-sponsored under-age-65 health insurance. currently, our leading health insurance sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65. these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees. if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65, demand for this product would likely decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales in this business. 7 table of contents an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. proposals for national health care reform could have a negative effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products that we sell. we sell supplemental limited-benefit health insurance products to individuals, as well as medicare supplement policies and medicare part d prescription drug insurance. addressing the affordability and availability of health insurance, including reducing the number of uninsured, is a major initiative of the administration and members of the u.s. congress, and proposals that would address these issues are pending in the u.s. congress and in many states. the proposals vary and include the following: a public health plan and other private health plans for individual and small business customers; individual insurance mandates; potential tax ramifications (including, among other things, additional taxes on health insurers); the expansion of eligibility under existing medicaid and/or federal employees health benefit plan programs; minimum medical benefit ratios for health plans; mandatory issuance of insurance coverage; limitations on antitrust immunity; and requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk. while certain of these measures could negatively affect us, at this time we cannot predict whether or when any of these measures will be enacted, and if enacted, the extent of the impact of these proposals on our business or results of operations. if any of these initiatives ultimately becomes effective, it could have a material negative effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products and services we sell and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. variable annuity marketplace risk: our variable annuity business is at risk should equity markets decline. revenues and underwriting income for variable annuities are based on policyholder account values which consist of investments primarily in equity markets. when equity markets decline, not only would revenues be expected to decline, but we would generally expect redemptions to increase, further negatively affecting revenues and underwriting income. as a part of this business, we also guarantee a minimum death benefit to policyholders to be paid regardless of account size upon death. therefore, even though variable annuities are no longer a significant part of our business and we no longer offer variable annuity products, because of this guaranteed death benefit, our obligation costs rise as the account balance declines. additionally, the decline in policyholder account size will require us to adjust our actuarial assumptions on this business to take into account the lower revenues. as a result, these revisions in assumptions could cause us to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and will generally negatively impact our underwriting income. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could 8 table of contents cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. difficult conditions in u.s. capital markets in recent periods have caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments. if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase or continue without improvement, there could be increased deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us. if difficult conditions in the capital markets and the economic recession continue or worsen, we could experience additional credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. also, while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio, a significant amount of our investments is in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, which have experienced an increased level of downgrades recently. moreover, we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. any further other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper and medium- and long-term debt. 9 table of contents the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, under certain state insurance laws, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations, excluding capital gains and losses, or 10% of statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and, as a result, limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time. in some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers. additionally, should credit spreads widen again in the future, the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets continue to experience significant disruption, uncertainty and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently 10 table of contents affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed. these proposals include the national insurance act of 2007, which would permit an optional federal charter for insurers. in light of recent events involving certain financial institutions, it is possible that the u.s. federal government will heighten its oversight of insurers, possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation. we cannot predict whether this or other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability. our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material 11 table of contents adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, caused by events such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism, or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area. these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity and geographic scope, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism and war, may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. information technology risk: the occurrence of computer viruses, network security breaches, disasters, or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries, destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business. in addition, despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers could be subject to physical and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary 12 table of contents business information. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal, and other expenses. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 59 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is found under the heading market risk sensitivity in item 7 beginning on page 47 of this report. 59 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a mature, regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation. adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical, as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time. increased competition has led to a reduction in agents in our united american branch office agency and united american independent agency, which have historically been our major health distribution channels. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products, our ability to market these products and our competitive position. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, 6 table of contents index to financial statements impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only the rating agency views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response distribution. the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. in recent years, labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers. most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by insertion into other mail media for distribution. significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business. medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our in-force health insurance business. because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future. the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other managed care or private plans. the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance. our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales. in recent years, price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market, as well as the market for other health products, has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we have elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. should these industry practices continue, it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed. an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are 7 table of contents index to financial statements coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. difficult conditions in u.s. capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments. if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase, there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us. if conditions in the capital markets worsen, we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. also, while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio, a significant amount of our investments is in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years. moreover, we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant 8 table of contents index to financial statements decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper and medium- and long-term debt. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and, as a result, limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. the capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time. in some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers. additionally, should credit spreads widen again in the future, the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities 9 table of contents index to financial statements or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office (fio), whose duties have not yet been defined, within the department of the treasury and the patient protection affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability. our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are 10 table of contents index to financial statements required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, caused by events such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism, or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area. these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity and geographic scope, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, and man- 11 table of contents index to financial statements made catastrophes, including terrorism and war, may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. information technology risk: the occurrence of computer viruses, network security breaches, disasters, or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries, destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business. in addition, despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers could be subject to physical and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal, and other expenses. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56risk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a mature, regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation. adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical, as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time. increased competition has led to a reduction in agents in our united american branch office agency and united american independent agency, which have historically been our major health distribution channels. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products, our ability to market these products and our competitive position. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, 6 table of contents impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only the rating agency views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response distribution. the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. in recent years, labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers. most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by insertion into other mail media for distribution. significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business. medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our in-force health insurance business. because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future. the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (hmos) and other managed care or private plans. the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance. our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales. in recent years, price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market, as well as the market for other health products, has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we have elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. should these industry practices continue, it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed. an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are 7 table of contents coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. difficult conditions in u.s. capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments. if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase, there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us. if conditions in the capital markets worsen, we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. also, while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio, a significant amount of our investments is in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years. moreover, we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant 8 table of contents decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper and medium- and long-term debt. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and, as a result, limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. the capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time. in some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers. additionally, should credit spreads widen again in the future, the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities 9 table of contents or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of

application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are 10 table of contents required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with

practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. catastrophic event risk: our

from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. information technology risk: the occurrence of computer viruses, network security breaches, disasters, or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of

incur significant technical, legal, and other expenses. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if

a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products, our ability to market these products and our competitive position. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, including limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, 6 table of contents index to financial statements impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. ratings reflect only the rating agency views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response distribution. the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales. in recent years, labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers. most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail, insertion into other mail media for distribution, internet marketing, or by inbound telephone calls. significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business. medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our in-force health insurance business. because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program, it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future. the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers. our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare, such as medicare advantage, or other health maintenance organizations (hmos) or managed care plans. the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance. our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales. in recent years, price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market, as well as the market for other health products, has been significant, characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share. we have elected not to compete on those terms, which has negatively affected sales. should these industry practices continue, it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed. an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are 7 table of contents index to financial statements coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, and general economic conditions, as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. difficult conditions in u.s. capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments. if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase, there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us. if conditions in the capital markets worsen, we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. also, while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio, a significant amount of our investments is in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years. moreover, we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant 8 table of contents index to financial statements decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper and medium- and long-term debt. the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and, as a result, limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. the capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time. in some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers. additionally, should credit spreads widen again in the future, the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity 9 table of contents index to financial statements decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office (fio) within the department of the treasury, and the affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability. our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 10 table of contents index to financial statements (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, caused by events such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism, or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area. these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity and geographic scope, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition. 11 table of contents index to financial statements the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism and war, may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. information technology risk: the occurrence of computer viruses, network security breaches, disasters, or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries, destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business. in addition, despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers could be subject to physical and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal, and other expenses. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52risk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical, as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could have a negative effect on our operations, including limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. 6 table of contents index to financial statements ratings reflect only the rating agency views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity published through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public receptivity to unsolicited direct response marketing could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: the health insurance market is more subject to legislative scrutiny than the life insurance market. legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement, medicare part d, and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. competition in the health market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share. we have chosen not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products. an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our 7 table of contents index to financial statements fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, and general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer, and other factors beyond our control. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance. 8 table of contents index to financial statements the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders, not our investors. state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business, including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries, marketing practices, advertising, licensing agents, policy forms, capital adequacy, solvency, reserves, and permitted investments. also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals. the insurance laws, regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time, possibly having an adverse effect on our business. should these changes to our business occur, we may be unable to maintain all 9 table of contents index to financial statements required licenses and approvals, and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents. these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. these actions can result in substantial fines, penalties, or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. additionally, changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulatory authority interpretation of an issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow, impact regulatory capital requirements, or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business. currently, the u.s. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. however, the dodd-frank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office (fio) within the department of the treasury, and the patient protection and affordable care act (affordable care act) created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight (cciio), originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct regulation of the insurance industry. we cannot predict what impact, if any, the fio and cciio, as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively effect our ability to sell some of our products. changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standard-setting bodies may affect our financial statements, reduce our reported profitability, and change the timing of profit recognition. our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), which principles are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies. it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. further, standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba) and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa). hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations). noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our business associates, could have a material 10 table of contents index to financial statements adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties, various forms of damages, consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief. litigation risk: litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries. we are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants, and, in certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis. however, the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers sales practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise agents, and other matters. these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive damages. in some states in which we operate, juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit. our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases, the costs of settlement or judgments against us, or changes in our operations that could result from litigation. substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which, in turn, could materially harm our business and our business prospects. catastrophic event risk: our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events. our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively low-face amounts. accordingly, it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster. however, our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, caused by events such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism, or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area. these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity and geographic scope, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism and war, may produce significant claims in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. information security and technology risk: a network security breach, the introduction of malware in our computing environment, a disaster, or other unanticipated event could affect the computer systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries, and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. despite our implementation of cyber security measures to protect our hardware, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access, our computing environment could be subject to physical and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems. we retain confidential information in our computer systems. anyone who is able to circumvent our cyber security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. in addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of 11 table of contents index to financial statements unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in an inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. in the event of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, or a terrorist attack or war, our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time. even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52risk factors 6 risk factors risks related to our business product marketplace and operational risks: the insurance industry is a regulated industry, populated by many firms. we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry, each with its own set of risks. the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits. because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals, rather than groups, and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market, the development, maintenance, and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical. adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical. in direct response, continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key. less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits. economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. we serve primarily the middle-income market for individual protection life and health insurance and, as a result, we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer disposable income. if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited, as a result of a significant, sustained economic downturn or otherwise, then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. variations in expected to actual rates of mortality, morbidity, and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain. the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality, morbidity, and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments. even though our actuaries continually test expected-to-actual results, actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set. accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments. significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income. a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including our insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations. these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products. a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways, including the following: limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies. rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us. credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity. actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could potentially have a negative effect on our operations, by limiting our access to capital markets, increasing the cost of debt, impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations, limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries, or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. 6 table of contents index to financial statements ratings reflect only the rating agency views and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company control. in addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models. changes to the models could impact the rating agencies judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company. there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency judgment, circumstances so warrant. we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. reputational risk: damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business. negative publicity published through traditional media, internet, social media, and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts, the ability to market our products, and the persistency of our block of inforce policies. life insurance marketplace risk: our life products are sold in selected niche markets. we are at risk should any of these markets diminish. we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches: labor union members and sales via direct response solicitation. deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public receptivity to unsolicited direct response marketing could negatively affect this business. health insurance marketplace risks: the health insurance market is subject to substantial legislative scrutiny. legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement, medicare part d, and other supplemental health businesses. the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business. competition in the health market can be significant. sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers, such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors. in addition, some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share. we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms. accordingly, changes in the competitive landscape, including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors, could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products. an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance. medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. as a result, it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success. because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program, which experiences health care inflation every year, annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary. obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market. accordingly, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability. 7 table of contents index to financial statements investment risks: our investments are subject to market and credit risks. our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults, downgrades, and changes in market values. substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixed-maturity and short-term investments. a significant portion of our fixed-maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds, exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment. factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels, financial market performance, disruptions in credit markets, general economic conditions, legislative changes, particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer, and other factors beyond our control. additionally, because the majority of our investments are longer-term fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity, significant increases in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio, even with regard to performing assets. these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders equity. it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable. in that case, the unrealized loss will be realized, at which point we would take an impairment charge, reducing our net income. difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades, delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio, potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses. a default by an issuer could result in a significant other-than-temporary impairment of that investment, causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income. the risk of default is higher for bonds with longer-term maturities, which we acquire in order to match our long-term insurance obligations. we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment. we cannot be assured that any particular issuer, regardless of industry, will be able to make required interest and principal payments, on a timely basis or at all. material other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower risk-based capital ratios, potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. while we intend to hold our investments until maturity, a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments, resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments. current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns, and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income. a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income. declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities. while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread, we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads. significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments, where such features are available to issuers. these calls could result in a decline in our investment income, as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates. liquidity risks: our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available, primarily dividends, from our insurance subsidiaries. as a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries, which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock. moreover, our liquidity, including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us, as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock, depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. other sources of liquidity also include a variety of short-term and long-term instruments, including our credit facility, commercial paper, long-term debt, intercompany financing, and reinsurance. 8 table of contents index to financial statements the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums, as well as investment income, maturities, repayments, and other cash flow from our investment portfolio. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans, and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. for example, in the states where our companies are domiciled, an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state. additionally, dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income, excluding capital gains, on an annual noncumulative basis or 10% of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval. accordingly, impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us, a principal source of our cash flow. we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which could, under certain circumstances, significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries. although we do not anticipate changes, changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. additionally, the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability, and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us. limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock. adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital, as well as affect our cost of capital. should credit spreads widen in the future, the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase, and our net income could be reduced. if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption, uncertainty, and instability, these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities (in a timely manner or at all) and/or access the capital necessary to grow our business. in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital. the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit or capital, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. additionally, customers, lenders, or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. as such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. therefore, as a result, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets. regulatory risks: our businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth. insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries,

laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives. in recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries, by insurance regulatory authorities, which has included more extensive

part d business, could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in u.s. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs. changes to the internal revenue code, administrative rulings, or court decisions affecting the insurance industry, including the products it offers, could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income, or negatively effect our
