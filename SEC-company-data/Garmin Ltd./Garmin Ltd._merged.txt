quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk......36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw material costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of the company's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because, until recently, the taiwan dollar has proven to be relatively stable. however, within the last two years we have experienced significant foreign currency gains due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the principal currency involved is the taiwan dollar. garmin corporation, located in shijr, taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our operations, we have elected to retain most of our cash at our taiwan subsidiary in u.s. dollars. as discussed above, the exchange rate increased 6.5% during 2001 and resulted in a foreign currency gain of $11.6 million. if the exchange rate decreased by a similar percentage, a comparable foreign currency loss would be recognized. interest rate risk as of december 29, 2001, we have interest rate risk in connection with our industrial revenue bonds that bear interest at a floating rate. garmin international, inc. entered into two interest rate swap agreements, one on july 1, 2000 ($10.0 million) and another on february 6, 2001 ($5.0 million), totaling $15.0 million to modify the characteristics of its outstanding long-term debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate basis. these agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. the estimated fair value of the interest swap agreements of $1.5 million is the amount we would be required to pay to terminate the swap agreements at december 29, 2001. a 10% positive or negative change in the floating counterparty interest rates associated with the swaps would change the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to $1.4 million (positive 10% change) or $1.6 million (negative 10% change), respectively. the company's average outstanding debt during fiscal year 2001 was approximately $39.3 million. the average interest rate on debt during fiscal 2001 was 5.5%. a 10% positive or negative change in the average interest rate during fiscal 2001 would have resulted in interest expense of $2.4 million (positive 10% change) or $1.9 million (negative 10% change), respectively. this compares to the actual interest expense of $2.2 million during fiscal 2001.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.......36 quantitative and qualitative

the exchange rate can be volatile. while the net effect of foreign currency moves in fiscal 2002 was neutral, there were significant shifts in the exchange rate throughout 2002. the exchange rate increased 6.5% during 2001 and resulted in a foreign currency gain of $11.6 million. if the exchange rate decreased by a similar percentage, a comparable foreign currency loss would be recognized. a 10% positive or negative change in the us dollar exchange rate versus the new taiwan dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of $18.7 million (positive 10% change) or a foreign currency loss of $18.9 million (negative 10% change), respectively during 2002. interest rate risk as of december 28, 2002, we have interest rate risk in connection with our industrial revenue bonds that bear interest at a floating rate. garmin international, inc. entered into two interest rate swap agreements, one on july 1, 2000 ($10.0 million notional) and another on february 6, 2001 ($5.0 million notional), totaling $15.0 million to modify the characteristics of its outstanding long-term debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate basis. these agreements involve the receipt of floating rate

$1.0 million is the amount we would be required to pay to terminate the swap agreements at december 28, 2002. a 10% positive or negative change in the floating counterparty interest rates associated with the swaps would change the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to $0.9 million (positive 10% change) or $1.1 million (negative 10% change), respectively. the company's average outstanding debt during fiscal 2002 was approximately $26 million. the average interest rate on debt during fiscal 2002 was 5.0%. the average outstanding debt during fiscal year 2001 was approximately $39.3 million. the average interest rate on debt during fiscal 2001 was 5.5%. a 10% positive or negative change in the average interest rate during fiscal 2002 would have resulted in

addition, at december 28, 2002 the company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with its investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains and losses. at december 28, 2002 unrealized gains on those securities were $1.2 million.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk..........37 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market

in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because, until recently, the taiwan dollar has proven to be relatively stable. however, periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the principal currency involved is the new taiwan dollar. garmin corporation, located in shijr,

taiwan dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of $22.1 million (positive 10% change) or a foreign currency loss of $22.1 million (negative 10% change) during 2003. interest rate risk as of december 27, 2003, we have no outstanding long-term debt, and therefore no debt-related interest rate risk. upon retiring the industrial revenue bond issue during 2003 as described above, garmin international, inc. also terminated two interest rate swap agreements, one with a $10.0 million notional amount and another with a $5.0 million notional amount at a cost of $0.6 million. the company's average outstanding debt during fiscal 2003 was approximately $10 million. the average interest rate on debt during fiscal 2003 was 3.5%. at december 27, 2003, the company is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with its investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses. at december 27, 2003, unrealized gains on those securities were $2.8 million. 38quantitative and

have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary cash and investments marketable securities in u.s. dollars. as discussed above, the new taiwan dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate can be volatile. the exchange rate decreased 5.5% during 2004 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of $24.8 million. the exchange rate decreased 3.0% during 2003 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of $6.7 million. while the net effect of foreign currency moves in fiscal 2002 was neutral, there were significant shifts in the exchange rate throughout 2002 a 10% positive or negative change in the us dollar exchange rate versus the new taiwan dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of $47.2 million (positive 10% change) or a foreign currency loss of $47.2 million (negative 10% change) during 2004. the majority of our worldwide sales are transacted in u.s. dollars. therefore, the impact on sales related to foreign currency movements is minimal. 43 interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt, and therefore no debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses. at december 25, 2004, unrealized losses on those securities were $1.9 million. 44risk factors 22 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos. we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment which has resulted in gps/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. mobile handsets are frequently gps-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins. our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 62% of our revenues and is maturing. we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge. this has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share. economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins. our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. 22 gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2011 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices (pnds) that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product's life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. we do not believe that we (or any of our non-united states subsidiaries) are currently a passive foreign investment company'' for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company's income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. we do not believe that we (or any of our non-united states subsidiaries) are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company's shares qualify as united states shareholders. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the company's shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company's income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company's stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company's stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past year that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. 23 if we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. 24 our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline. as we expand our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales. if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter. our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters. sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season. sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of garmin's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company's exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary's cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. nonetheless, u.s. gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such u.s. dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary. this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. this u.s. gaap-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate varies. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the company's operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation. if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. 25 rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available. our effective tax rate is lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan. the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people's republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in taiwan. taiwan has a unique international political status. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other's rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. 26 we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas n.v. navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas n.v. is owned by tomtom n.v. nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 (extending our navteq license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. 27 we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management's attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. we may have additional tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers' ability to sell airplanes. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. 28 there is uncertainty as to our shareholders' ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the u.s. to be grounded for several days. in addition to this shut down of u.s. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules (vfr). the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa) airspace areas. the aircraft owners and pilots association (aopa) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas. the aopa estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules (ifr). the shutdown of u.s. airspace following september 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe, kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any future shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business. in addition, there can be no assurance that the u.s. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the u.s. government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system, other u.s. government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals. however, in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004, the bush administration indicated that the u.s. is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees. some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps, such as the wide area augmentation system (waas). waas is operated by the faa. any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. 29 any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government's global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. for example, the fcc is currently considering a proposal by a private party, lightsquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the united states. if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared's proposal as is, terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. there are a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions. for example, in june 2009 the u.s. house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act that would phase-in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law. the u.s. senate is considering one or more different bills, and it is uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted. similarly, certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol. these actions could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for components used in the manufacture of our products and freight costs. because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 30 risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2010, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $26.55 to a high of $39.94. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates; announcements of technological innovations; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; and any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 14, 2011, members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 44.80% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. on june 27, 2010 we completed the redomestication of the place of our incorporation from the cayman islands to switzerland (the redomestication ). as a result of increased shareholder approval requirements under swiss law, we have less flexibility than we previously had as a cayman islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management. swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders' meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders' meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by a shareholders' meeting every two years. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law does not provide as much flexibility as cayman islands law in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares either. for example, while the board of directors of a cayman islands company can authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval, we will not be able to issue preferred stock without the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes represented and a majority of the par value of the shares represented at a general meeting of our shareholders. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which our board of directors previously had authority under cayman islands law. for example, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders. 31 the par value of our shares is higher following the redomestication. as a result, we have less flexibility than we previously had as a cayman islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management. the par value of our shares is 10 swiss francs per share, compared to a par value of $0.005 per share when we were a cayman islands company. under swiss law, we may not issue shares below par value. in the event we need to raise equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares, we will be unable to issue shares. in addition, we will not be able to issue options under our benefits plans with an exercise price below the par value, which would limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements. we are subject to various swiss taxes following the redomestication. although we do not expect swiss taxes to materially affect our worldwide effective corporate tax rate, we are subject to additional corporate taxes in switzerland following the redomestication. switzerland imposes a corporate federal income tax for holding companies at an effective tax rate of 7.83%, although we should be entitled to a participation relief that in most cases will effectively eliminate any swiss taxation on the profits of our subsidiaries paid by them to us as dividends as well as on capital gains related to the sale of participations. we also are subject to a swiss issuance stamp tax levied on our share issuances, other than in connection with qualifying restructurings, or increases of our equity at a rate of 1% of the fair market value of the issuance or increase. in addition, we are subject to some other swiss indirect taxes (e.g., vat, swiss issuance stamp tax on certain debt instruments and swiss securities transfer stamp tax). we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to swiss withholding tax. however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future. in addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. under swiss tax law applicable until december 31, 2010, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction have been treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. on january 1, 2011, under swiss laws the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the swiss stock exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. 58 inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company's exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary's cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. all european subsidiaries excluding garmin (europe) ltd., garmin danmark, garmin sweden, garmin polska and garmin norge use the euro as the functional currency . the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. in 2010, the u.s. dollar strengthened 8.8% relative to the euro and 3.3% relative to the british pound sterling. these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency loss of $51.0 million in garmin ltd. and our european subsidiaries. a loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the u.s. dollar weakening 5.9% against the taiwan dollar. the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of $1.3 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $88.4 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $61.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010. interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 25, 2010. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses. at december 25, 2010, cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were $4.6 million. 59risk factors 25 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos. we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment which has resulted in gps/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. mobile handsets are frequently gps-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins. our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 58% of our revenues and is maturing. we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge. this has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share. 25 economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins. our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2012 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices (pnds) that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&rsquo;s life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. we do not believe that we (or any of our non-united states subsidiaries) are currently a &lsquo;&lsquo;passive foreign investment company&rsquo;&rsquo; for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company&rsquo;s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. we do not believe that we (or any of our non-united states subsidiaries) are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the company&rsquo;s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company&rsquo;s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company&rsquo;s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company&rsquo;s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. 26 legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. if we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 27 we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline. as we expand our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales. if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter. our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters. sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season. sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. nonetheless, u.s. gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such u.s. dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary. this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. this u.s. gaap-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate varies. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the company&rsquo;s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation. 28 if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: &middot; if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. &middot; rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. &middot; if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available. our effective tax rate is lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan. the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in taiwan. taiwan has a unique international political status. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other&rsquo;s rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. 29 third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas n.v. navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas n.v. is owned by tomtom n.v. nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin. 30 although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 (extending our navteq license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&rsquo;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. we may have additional tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in switzerland, the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers&rsquo; ability to sell airplanes. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. 31 there is uncertainty as to our shareholders&rsquo; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the u.s. to be grounded for several days. in addition to this shut down of u.s. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules (vfr). the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa) airspace areas. the aircraft owners and pilots association (aopa) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas. the aopa estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules (ifr). the shutdown of u.s. airspace following september 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe, kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any future shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. 32 gps is operated by the u. s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u. s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government&rsquo;s global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. for example, the fcc is currently considering a proposal by a private party, lightsquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the united states. if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared&rsquo;s proposal as is, terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. 33 regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions. any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion. in the aftermath of its 2009 &ldquo;endangerment finding&rdquo; that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the epa has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business . because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2011, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $30.14 to a high of $40.39. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: &middot; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; &middot; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; 34 &middot; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; &middot; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates; &middot; announcements of technological innovations; &middot; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; &middot; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; &middot; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; &middot; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; &middot; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; and &middot; any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 10, 2012, current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 44.40% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.&rsquo;s articles of association and organizational regulations. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting at least every two years. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also provides that dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders. we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax. however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future. in addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. 35 under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a &quot;second trading line&quot; on the swiss stock exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 62 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. 62 all european subsidiaries excluding garmin (europe) ltd., garmin danmark, garmin sweden, garmin polska and garmin norge use the euro as the functional currency . the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. in 2011, the u.s. dollar strengthened 1.3% relative to the euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $4.8 million in garmin ltd. and our european subsidiaries. the u.s. dollar weakened 1.2% against the taiwan dollar resulting in a $4.1 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year. the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $3.2 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $12.1 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $76.0 million at the end of fiscal 2011. interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 31, 2011. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses. at december 31, 2011, cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were $11.5 million. 63risk factors 25 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. 25 risks related to the company the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) has been reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos. from 2005 to 2008, we experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment. this has resulted in gps/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. mobile handsets are frequently gps-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and reduced margins. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduced margins. our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 55% of our revenues, is maturing and expected to further decline in 2013. we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge. this has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower revenues and lower earnings per share. economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins. our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have declined and could further decline in the future due to price reductions in the competitive market for navigation solutions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&rsquo;s life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. we do not believe that we (or any of our non-united states subsidiaries) are currently a &lsquo;&lsquo;passive foreign investment company&rsquo;&rsquo; for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company&rsquo;s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. 26 we do not believe that we (or any of our non-united states subsidiaries) are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the company&rsquo;s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company&rsquo;s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company&rsquo;s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company&rsquo;s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. if we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 27 if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our selling, general and administrative and research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales. if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. 28 nonetheless, u.s. gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such u.s. dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary. this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. this u.s. gaap-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate varies. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the company&rsquo;s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation. if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: &mdash; if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. &mdash; rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. &mdash; if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available. our effective tax rate is lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan. the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in taiwan. taiwan has a unique international political status. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future. 29 our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other&rsquo;s rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. 30 we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas n.v. navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas n.v. is owned by tomtom n.v. nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 (extending our navteq license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&rsquo;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. we may have additional tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in switzerland, the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 31 failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers&rsquo; ability to sell airplanes. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. there is uncertainty as to our shareholders&rsquo; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the u.s. to be grounded for several days. in addition to this shut down of u.s. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules (vfr). the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa) airspace areas. the aircraft owners and pilots association (aopa) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas. the aopa estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules (ifr). the shutdown of u.s. airspace following september 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe, kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any future shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 32 many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. gps is operated by the u. s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u. s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government&rsquo;s global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 33 privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions. any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion. in the aftermath of its 2009 &ldquo;endangerment finding&rdquo; that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business . because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 34 risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2012, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $35.84 to a high of $49.33. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: &middot; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; &middot; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; &middot; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; &middot; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates; &middot; announcements of technological innovations; &middot; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; &middot; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; &middot; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; &middot; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; &middot; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; and &middot; any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 9, 2013, current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.48% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.&rsquo;s articles of association and organizational regulations. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. 35 we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax. however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. there are currently legislative projects pending in swiss parliament and the swiss federal administration that &ndash; depending on their final form &ndash; may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves. in addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a &quot;second trading line&quot; on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 65 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency . the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. in 2012, the u.s. dollar weakened 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $10.4 million in garmin ltd. and our european subsidiaries. the u.s. dollar weakened 3.8% against the taiwan dollar resulting in a $31.3 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year. the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of $0.8 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $20.0 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $129.0 million at the end of fiscal 2012. interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 29, 2012. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses. at december 29, 2012, pre-tax cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were $10.4 million. 65risk factors 17 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos. from 2005 to 2008, we experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment. this has resulted in gps/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. mobile handsets and tablets are frequently gps-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and reduced margins. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduced margins. our financial results are dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 50% of our revenues, is maturing and expected to further decline in 2014. we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market has peaked as penetration rates increased and competing technologies emerged. this has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share. economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins. our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. 17 gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product's life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a passive foreign investment company'' for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company's income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company's shares qualify as united states shareholders. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the company's shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company's income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company's stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company's stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states. legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland. our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss, united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. 18 if we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. 19 our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales. if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of garmin's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company's exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary's cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. nonetheless, u.s. gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such u.s. dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary. this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. this u.s. gaap-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollar/u.s. dollar exchange rate varies. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the company's operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation. if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. 20 rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available. our effective tax rate is lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan. the loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people's republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in taiwan. taiwan has a unique international political status. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other's rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. 21 we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are here (formerly known as navteq) and tele atlas n.v. here is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas n.v. is owned by tomtom n.v. nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and here in june 2010 (extending our here license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. 22 we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management's attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. we may have additional tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in switzerland, the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers' ability to sell airplanes. delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. 23 there is uncertainty as to our shareholders' ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the u.s. to be grounded for several days. in addition to this shut down of u.s. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules (vfr). the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa) airspace areas. the aircraft owners and pilots association (aopa) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas. the aopa estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules (ifr). the shutdown of u.s. airspace following september 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe, kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any future shut down of u.s. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business. any failure of congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. gps is operated by the u. s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u. s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 24 some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), and european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government's global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. for example, the fcc has been considering a proposal by a private party, lightsquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the united states. if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared's proposal, terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. 25 security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions. any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion. in the aftermath of its 2009 endangerment finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business. because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2013, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $32.60 to a high of $49.33. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates; changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates; announcements of technological innovations; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; 26 developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; and any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 13, 2014, current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.30% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.'s articles of association. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders' meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders' meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders' meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax. however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. there are currently legislative projects pending in swiss parliament and the swiss federal administration that depending on their final form may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves. in addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. 27 under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the currencies that create a majority of the company's exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary's cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency . the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. in 2013, the u.s. dollar weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $7.5 million in garmin ltd. and our european subsidiaries. the u.s. dollar strengthened 3.3% against the taiwan dollar resulting in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year. the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of $35.5 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $43.6 million at the end of fiscal 2013. 58 interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 28, 2013. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. in 2013, garmin experienced unrealized, non-cash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of $57,356 of gross other-than-temporary impairment and $4,377 of other unrealized losses on marketable securities at december 28, 2013. the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at december 28, 2013 were $1,215,498 and $1,153,765, respectively. this decrease in estimated fair value is primarily due to market valuations on mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining. the decline was due to increases in the 10 year treasury bond yield during 2013, which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline. approximately 50% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at december 28, 2013. an immaterial amount of those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer. we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered. we do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities. we do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income. 59risk factors 18 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company if we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. 18 if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation. gps/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins. our financial results are dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 43% of our revenues, and is expected to decline in 2015. we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. this has resulted in, and could continue to result in, periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share. economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins. our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. 19 if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: &middot; if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. &middot; rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. &middot; if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&rsquo;s life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 20 our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation. the u.s. dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe. the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries. as these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses. additionally, euro-based inter-company transactions in garmin ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses. other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar, the euro and the british pound sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company&rsquo;s financial statements. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. u.s. gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. this u.s. gaap-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the u.s. dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the company&rsquo;s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation. changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states. legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland. our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss, united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a &lsquo;&lsquo;passive foreign investment company&rsquo;&rsquo; for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company&rsquo;s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. 21 we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the company&rsquo;s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company&rsquo;s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company&rsquo;s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company&rsquo;s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available. our effective tax rate has historically been lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan. the loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in taiwan. taiwan has a unique international political status. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other&rsquo;s rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. 22 we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. in the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. 23 we have a technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. a party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information. actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure. if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. in addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are here (formerly known as navteq) and tomtom n.v. here is owned by nokia oyj and tomtom n.v. is owned by tomtom n.v. nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and here in february 2015 extending our here license agreement through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. we may have additional income tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in switzerland, the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers&rsquo; ability to sell airplanes. delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 24 our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales. if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our fitness, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. 25 any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&rsquo;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. there is uncertainty as to our shareholders&rsquo; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business. any failure of congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. gps is operated by the u. s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u. s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 26 some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), and european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government&rsquo;s global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion. in the aftermath of its 2009 &ldquo;endangerment finding&rdquo; that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business . 27 because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2014, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $43.63 to a high of $61.69. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: &middot; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; &middot; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates; &middot; announcements of technological innovations; &middot; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; &middot; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; &middot; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; &middot; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; &middot; changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates; &middot; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; &middot; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; &middot; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; &middot; any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products; and &middot; other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 25, 2015, current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.62% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. 28 the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.&rsquo;s articles of association. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax. however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. there are currently legislative projects pending in swiss parliament and the swiss federal administration that &ndash; depending on their final form &ndash; may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves. in addition, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes. under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a &quot;second trading line&quot; on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase. 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in sijhih, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency . the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. in 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened 11.4% and 5.5%, respectively, relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency loss of $43.7 million in garmin ltd. and our european subsidiaries. the u.s. dollar strengthened 5.5% against the taiwan dollar resulting in a $44.8 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year. the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $5.4 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $4.3 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $64.5 million during the fiscal year 2014. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. based on total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 27, 2014, a hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse change of 10% for the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $118 million at december 27, 2014. 58 interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 27, 2014. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. the company&rsquo;s investment policy requires investments to be rated a or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. during 2014 and 2013, the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company&rsquo;s portfolio of marketable securities. based on balance sheet positions as of december 27, 2014, a hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in an approximate $52 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity. 59risk factors 17 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company if we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits. we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices. if the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of our subsidiaries in global markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain other currencies. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. we have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation, the u.s. dollar is the functional currency of garmin (europe) ltd., and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds. other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. income and expense activity in a currency other than the u.s. dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time. the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. however, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses. changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company. our tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns, particularly in the us, switzerland, taiwan, and uk. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. global taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (beps) by multinational corporations. while these recommendations do not change tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. partially to respond to recent and continuing changes to global tax standards, we initiated an intercompany transaction which migrates ownership of certain consumer products intellectual property from switzerland to the united states, which is the primary location of research, development and executive management. due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction, we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing. however, we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations, which could materially and/or adversely impact our income tax provision, net income or cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, most notably in the area of transfer pricing. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 18 changes to trade regulations, including trade restrictions, sanctions, or tariffs, could significantly harm our results of operations. we manufacture goods in the people's republic of china and import certain materials from the people's republic of china that are used to manufacture goods in the united states. the imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade, trade sanctions, or tariffs, particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the people's republic of china, could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. economic, regulatory, and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits. our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. we have global operations which make up a significant portion of our total revenue, which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale. economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past, and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. our principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people's republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands, and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. the united states' relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act, which signifies when the u.s. switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc, referred to as the "one-china" policy. deviations from the "one-china" policy could lead to adverse changes in china-u.s. and china-taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future. if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. 19 we depend on third party suppliers and licensors, some of which are sole source, for specific components and map data used in our products. our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past, we have experienced shortages of certain components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. we are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions. if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from our suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if our relationships with our suppliers change detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. the effects of the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union ( brexit ), including trade agreements, are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations. the united kingdom (uk) formally left the european union (eu) on january 31, 2020. a transition period through december 31, 2020 has been established to allow the uk and eu to negotiate the terms of the uk's withdrawal. however, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu, including trade agreements between the uk and eu. additionally, long-term risks of brexit include economic recessions in the uk or other european markets and currency instability for both the british pound sterling and the euro. we have operations in the uk, including offices and a distribution facility, and several eu member states, and therefore brexit will impact our operations. we have certain measures in place to reduce the impact to our business operations however, risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance, prolonged economic recession, and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition. as noted in our other risk factors, currency volatility of the british sterling pound and euro could have significant effects on our results of operations. depending on finalization of a trade agreement between the uk and the eu during the transition period, the impacts of brexit may have a lesser impact to our financial condition and business operations. given the number of different outcomes still possible, the impacts of brexit are difficult to determine until specific terms of the withdrawal are reached. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others' rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. in addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. 20 the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. for example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers. the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our products malfunction or contain errors or defects, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition. continued declines in auto pnd revenue and significant investments in auto oem could negatively impact total company profits and shareholder value. we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in our auto segment as pnds became mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this auto pnd market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. navigation technologies have been incorporated into and become more prevalent in competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. the acceptance by consumers of these alternative solutions has negatively impacted sales and profits in the auto segment. there is no assurance that the decline in sales will end, and thus no assurance that we can continue to generate profits from the auto segment. we have recently been awarded several tier-one and tier-two auto oem supplier contracts. to fulfill the associated program commitments, we are investing significantly in facilities, research and development, and other operating expenses and we will continue to do so in the coming years. gross margins associated with these auto oem programs are expected to be lower than the gross margins realized in the auto segment and the company as a whole in recent periods. if we are not successful in winning additional contract awards or substantially leveraging our investments, periods of lower operating income or operating losses in the auto segment could negatively impact total company profits and shareholder value. 21 our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased warranty claims, and litigation . undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or use competitive products. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our business. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. our users' personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns, gps-based location, and activity patterns. due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. if our security measures or applications are breached, are disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data. if we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users' data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident. a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers are not secure against third-party access. additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users' information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. while we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, including in the united states, have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in may 2018, the general data protection regulation (gdpr) went into effect in the eu. on january 1, 2020, the california consumer privacy act (ccpa) went into effect, and other states in the united states are considering adopting data privacy laws. noncompliance with gdpr. ccpa, or other data protection laws in other states in the united states or in other countries, could result in significant fines and penalties. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe, asia, latin america, and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. 22 we rely on information technology systems for our business operations. failures or disruptions, including security breaches or cyber attacks, to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations. our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively. these systems assist in our business processes, including, but not limited to, communications, financial management, supply chain management, order processing, shipping and billing, and providing services and support to our customers. additionally, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. a disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations. furthermore, a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. a party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information. actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure. if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. in addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product's life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 23 changes in our united states federal income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater u.s. shareholders. the tax cuts and jobs act (the 2017 act ) signed on december 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to u.s. shareholders that own, or are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a non-u.s. corporation (a 10% u.s. shareholder) under the u.s. federal income tax law applicable to owners of u.s. controlled foreign corporations ( cfcs ). prior to the 2017 act, the company did not believe we, or any of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, were considered a cfc, which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10% u.s. shareholders together own, or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a non-u.s. corporation. the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10% u.s. shareholder. this may be the result without regard to whether 10% u.s. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules. the repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of cfcs beginning before january 1, 2018 and for the taxable year of 10% u.s. shareholders in which the cfcs' taxable year ends. additional tax consequences to 10% u.s. shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act. for example, the 2017 act amended section 965 to require 10% u.s. shareholders to include in income their pro-rata share of certain earnings and profits (e p) of cfcs. this section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividends-received deduction. the 2017 act also added section 951a which requires a 10% u.s. shareholder of a cfc to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) of the cfc. finally, the 2017 act eliminated the requirement in section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% u.s. shareholder to have a current income inclusion. from time to time, the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program. these measures could inadvertently create additional 10% u.s. shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above. we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the u.s. federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability. some of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis, either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process, could harm our business. federal aviation administration (faa) certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers' ability to sell airplanes. delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. additionally, failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in a shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees, due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise, could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. therefore, such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. in addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. in addition, in accordance with fcc rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc in the united states and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. garmin's products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission. a delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to garmin's products, or losing certification for garmin's existing products could adversely affect our business. 24 our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods. if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, evaluate, complete, and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. 25 any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management's attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the gdpr and other corporate governance and regulatory matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems (gnss). the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of gps and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. gps is operated by the u.s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however, if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u.s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), and european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system. other countries, including china and india, are in the process of creating their own gnss systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems. the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as galileo. national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position. use of non-us gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. 26 our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government's gps satellites. gps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. natural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change could affect our financial results. natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis or earthquakes, and medical epidemics or pandemics, such as covid-19 (coronavirus disease), could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory. these events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain. if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events, our financial results could be adversely affected. climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change. the u.s. environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, u.s. congress could pass legislation to adopt some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program. it is also possible that the u.s. congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends, which could decrease the demand for certain of our products. because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 27 risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2019, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of $61.39 to a high of $98.68. a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates announcements of technological innovations product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products and other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 16, 2020, members of our board of directors, and our executive officers, together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 22% of our outstanding shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.'s articles of association. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders' meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders' meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders' meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. 28 we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to switzerland withholding tax. as of december 28, 2019, we had chf 5,650 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the company may make dividend payments or utilize to repurchase shares for which no withholding tax applies. at the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, a swiss federal withholding tax of 35% will generally be applicable to any dividends paid to shareholders. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax. for example, a u.s holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). after we have exhausted our remaining capital contribution reserves by appropriating them for dividends or share repurchases, any dividends paid by the company will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at 35%. however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. if we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes. under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient capital reserves are available. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period. there is uncertainty as to our shareholders' ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. 29 we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin's subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically used financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that create a majority of the company's exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary's cash and investments in accounts denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency. however, the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd., is the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions have occurred and balances reside in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. gains and losses may become more material in the future as our european presence grows. during fiscal year 2019, the company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $16.8 million. the u.s. dollar strengthening against the euro and weakening against the taiwan dollar was partially offset by the u.s. dollar weakening against the british pound sterling. during fiscal 2019, the u.s. dollar strengthened 2.3% against the euro and weakened 1.5% against the taiwan dollar, resulting in losses of $9.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively, while the u.s. dollar weakened 2.9% against the british pound sterling, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million. the remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2019 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $8.0 million within accumulated other comprehensive income on the company's consolidated balance sheets. we assessed the company's exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes on the company's consolidated statements of income of approximately $90 and $109 million at december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, respectively. 47 interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 29, 2018. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. the company's investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. during 2019 and 2018, the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. we assessed the company's exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company's portfolio of marketable securities. based on balance sheet positions as of december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $35 million and $38 million at december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, respectively. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity. 48risk factors 17 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company if we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation. gps/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins. our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks. 17 the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation. the u.s. dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe. the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries. as these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses. additionally, euro denominated inter-company transactions in garmin ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses. other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar, the euro and the british pound sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company&rsquo;s financial statements. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. u.s. gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. this u.s. gaap-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the u.s. dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the company&rsquo;s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation. the auto segment, which represents approximately 37% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2016. we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. this has resulted in, and could continue to result in, periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share. economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins. our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: &middot; if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. &middot; rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. &middot; if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. 18 we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&rsquo;s life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 19 changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states. legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland. our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss, united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. recently, the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) issued final recommendations to prevent perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations. while these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a &lsquo;&lsquo;passive foreign investment company&rsquo;&rsquo; for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company&rsquo;s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. currently the company has two shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting power, totaling 35% of the outstanding shares. thus, the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater united states shareholder could result in classification as a cfc and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the company&rsquo;s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company&rsquo;s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company&rsquo;s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company&rsquo;s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available. our effective tax rate has historically been lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan. the loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future. 20 we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in taiwan. taiwan has a unique international political status. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other&rsquo;s rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 21 we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. our users&rsquo; fitness-related data and personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, heart rates, sleeping patterns, gps-based location, and activity patterns. due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. if our security measures and applications are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data. if we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach of systems compromising our users&rsquo; data or the media suggested that our security measures were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident. a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users&rsquo; information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. while we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. in the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. a party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information. 22 actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure. if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. in addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our auto products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are here (formerly known as navteq) and tomtom n.v. here is owned by here acquisition b.v. (a consortium of daimler ag, bmw ag and audi ag). here acquisition b.v. is owned by competitors to other global oems, who may not wish to utilize mapping content from a competitor. tomtom n.v. is a competitor of garmin. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and here in february 2015 extending our here license agreement through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. we may have additional income tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in switzerland, the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers&rsquo; ability to sell airplanes. delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 23 our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales. if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our fitness, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. 24 any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&rsquo;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. there is uncertainty as to our shareholders&rsquo; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business. any failure of congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. gps is operated by the u.s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u.s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), and european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. 25 any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government&rsquo;s global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion. in the aftermath of its 2009 &ldquo;endangerment finding&rdquo; that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business . 26 because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2015, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $32.28 to a high of $56.81. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: &middot; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; &middot; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates; &middot; announcements of technological innovations; &middot; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; &middot; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; &middot; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; &middot; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; &middot; changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates; &middot; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; &middot; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; &middot; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; &middot; any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products; and &middot; other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks. in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 25, 2016, current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 41.1% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. 27 the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.&rsquo;s articles of association. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. the company has limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a &quot;second trading line&quot; on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase. 28 we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors. as mentioned previously, we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. however, the repurchase of the company&rsquo;s shares reduces the number of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. we may be limited in the number of shares we repurchase due to united states shareholders holding percentages. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in xizhi, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency . the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. in 2015, the u.s. dollar strengthened 10.0% relative to the euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $31.2 million in garmin ltd. and our european subsidiaries. the u.s. dollar strengthened 3.8% against the taiwan dollar resulting in a $19.5 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year. the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $11.8 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $23.5 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $35.0 million during the fiscal year 2015. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $95 million and $118 million at december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014. 54 interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 26, 2015. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. the company&rsquo;s investment policy requires investments to be rated a or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. during 2015 and 2014, the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company&rsquo;s portfolio of marketable securities. based on balance sheet positions as of december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all maturities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $43 million and $52 million at december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity. 55risk factors 19 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company if we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits. we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices. if the wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline, such as fitness trackers or smartwatches, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation. gps/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced profits in some periods. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits. 19 the auto segment, which represents approximately 29% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2017. we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as pnds became mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. this has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, periods of lower revenues and profits for this segment. our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain other currencies. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. we have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation, the u.s. dollar is the functional currency of garmin (europe) ltd., and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds. other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. income and expense activity in a currency other than the u.s. dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time. the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. however, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses. changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company. our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss, united states or foreign tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland. corporate reform being considered in the united states could significantly change our tax liability such as proposals to remove certain domestic deductions, implement border adjustments, and/or broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states. moreover, international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations. while these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. restrictions on trade, particularly on goods imported from taiwan or the people&rsquo;s republic of china, could significantly harm our results of operations a significant portion of our global and u.s. sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in taiwan and the prc. the imposition of additional u.s. or foreign governmental controls, regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade with the u.s., or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the u.s., including goods imported from china and taiwan, could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition. economic, regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits. our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. the united kingdom (uk) held a referendum on june 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union (eu). due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal, significant uncertainty exists surrounding the timing and terms of the expected exit. we have operations in the uk and several eu member states whose currencies, namely british pound sterling (gbp) and euro, economies, taxation, and trade regulation, among other factors, could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the uk&rsquo;s leaving the eu, which is likely to be a lengthy and complicated process. these events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. 20 if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: &middot; if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. &middot; rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. &middot; if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&rsquo;s life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 21 changes in our united states federal income tax classification could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a &lsquo;&lsquo;passive foreign investment company&rsquo;&rsquo; for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company. however, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company&rsquo;s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain. further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above. we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. we do not expect to become a cfc. the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. currently the company has two shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting power, totaling 36% of the outstanding shares. thus, the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater united states shareholder could result in classification as a cfc and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences. if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty-day period in any year, the company&rsquo;s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the company&rsquo;s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc. as the company cannot control the ownership of the company&rsquo;s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company&rsquo;s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc. 22 we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. our principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. the united states' relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act, which signifies when the u.s. switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc, referred to as the &quot;one-china&quot; policy. deviations from the &quot;one-china&quot; policy could lead to adverse changes in china-u.s. and china-taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future. our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other&rsquo;s rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. 23 we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. our users&rsquo; fitness-related data and personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, heart rates, sleeping patterns, gps-based location, and activity patterns. due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. if our security measures or applications are breached, disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data. if we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users&rsquo; data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident. a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers are not secure against third-party access. additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users&rsquo; information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. while we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. 24 regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, and a newly adopted data protection regulation in the e.u. will go into effect in may 2018. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. in the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. a party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information. actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure. if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. in addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our auto products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise. we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. the two largest digital map suppliers are here (formerly known as navteq) and tomtom n.v. here is owned by here acquisition b.v. (a consortium of daimler ag, bmw ag and audi ag). here acquisition b.v. and tomtom n.v. are also competitors of garmin. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement between garmin and here extending through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. 25 failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers&rsquo; ability to sell airplanes. delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods. if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our fitness, outdoor, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. 26 we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&rsquo;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. there is uncertainty as to our shareholders&rsquo; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business. any failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 27 many of our products rely on the global positioning system. the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. gps is operated by the u.s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however, if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u.s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), global navigation satellite system (glonass), and european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government&rsquo;s global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. 28 any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion. in the aftermath of its 2009 &ldquo;endangerment finding&rdquo; that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare, the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that the u.s. congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business . because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2016, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of $32.29 to a high of $55.75. a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: &middot; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; &middot; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates; &middot; announcements of technological innovations; &middot; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; &middot; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; &middot; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; &middot; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; &middot; changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates; &middot; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; &middot; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; &middot; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; &middot; any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products; and &middot; other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks. 29 in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 18, 2017, current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 41.36% of our outstanding common shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.&rsquo;s articles of association. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 30 under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a &quot;second trading line&quot; on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase. we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors. as mentioned previously, we do not believe that we, or any of our united states or non-united states subsidiaries, are currently a controlled foreign corporation (cfc) for united states federal income tax purposes. however, the repurchase of the company&rsquo;s shares reduces the number of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company. only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company&rsquo;s shares qualify as united states shareholders. we may be limited in the number of shares we repurchase due to united states shareholders holding percentages. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks. 57 the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in xizhi, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency. the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. during fiscal year 2016, the u.s. dollar weakened 1.7% against the taiwan dollar resulting in a $9.2 million foreign currency loss. the u.s. dollar strengthened 4.2% against the euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $13.0 million. the u.s. dollar strengthened 16.8% against the british pound sterling resulting in a loss of $5.1 million. the net result of these currency moves combined with other net losses of $4.4 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $31.7 million for the company and a currency translation adjustment of $4.7 million during the fiscal year 2016. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 31, 2016 and december 26, 2015, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $92 million and $95 million at december 31, 2016 and december 26, 2015. interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 31, 2016. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. the company&rsquo;s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. during 2016 and 2015, the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company&rsquo;s portfolio of marketable securities. based on balance sheet positions as of december 31, 2016 and december 26, 2015, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $45 million and $43 million at december 31, 2016 and december 26, 2015. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity. 58risk factors 20 risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. risks related to the company if we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset. we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories. the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. if we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. however, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance. if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. the markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 20 maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits. we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices. in 2017, the fitness tracker market rapidly contracted, resulting in lower sales and profits in our fitness segment. if the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the demand for personal navigation devices (pnds) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation. gps/navigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in the auto segment and has reduced profits in some periods. navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard and/or optional equipment on new automobiles. increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits. the auto segment, which represents approximately 24% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2018. we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as pnds became mass-market consumer electronics in both europe and north america. this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. this has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, lower revenues and profits for this segment. our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation. the operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain other currencies. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. we have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation, the u.s. dollar is the functional currency of garmin (europe) ltd., and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds. other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. income and expense activity in a currency other than the u.s. dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time. the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. however, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses. 21 changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company. our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland. switzerland has agreed with the european union (eu) to execute tax reform by 2019 in exchange for the eu&rsquo;s waiver of counter-measures. a failure to accomplish tax reform in the agreed timeframe may result in the eu member states reasserting counter-measure provisions which could result in additional tax for the company. moreover, international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations. while these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. restrictions on trade, particularly on goods imported from taiwan or the people&rsquo;s republic of china, could significantly harm our results of operations a significant portion of our global and u.s. sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china. the imposition of additional u.s. or foreign governmental controls, regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade with the u.s., or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the u.s., including goods imported from china and taiwan, could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition. economic, regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits. our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. the united kingdom (uk) is scheduled to formally leave the european union on march 29, 2019. due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal, significant uncertainty exists surrounding the terms of the expected exit. we have operations in the uk and several eu member states whose currencies, namely british pound sterling (gbp) and euro, economies, taxation, and trade regulation, among other factors, could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the uk&rsquo;s leaving the eu, which is likely to be a complicated process. these events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. 22 if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories. we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. however, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast. we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature. significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations: &bull; if demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. &bull; rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. these higher costs could lower our profit margins. further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction. &bull; if forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins. we depend on third party suppliers and licensors, some of which are sole source, for specific components and map data used in our products. our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise. we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. the cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. some components we use are from sole source suppliers. certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components. in the past, we have experienced shortages of certain components. in addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed. we are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products. there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions. the largest digital map supplier for our auto products is here (formerly known as navteq), which is majority-owned by a consortium of daimler ag, bmw ag, and audi ag. although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data from here at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement with an option to extend through 2028, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from here and other primary suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with primary suppliers changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed. 23 our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other&rsquo;s rights or are infringed upon by others. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. to this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. however, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. in addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries. moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. for example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers. the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. we may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products. we may become subject to significant product liability costs. if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. if any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. we maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. in addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition. our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased warranty claims, and litigation undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. we collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. our users&rsquo; personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns, gps-based location, and activity patterns. due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. if our security measures or applications are breached, disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data. if we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users&rsquo; data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident. a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers are not secure against third-party access. additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users&rsquo; information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. while we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, and a new data protection regulation in the e.u. with significant fines and penalties for noncompliance will go into effect in may 2018. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the u.s., europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. 25 we rely on information technology systems for our business operations. failures or disruptions, including security breaches or cyber attacks, to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations. our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively. these systems assist in our business processes, including, but not limited to, communications, financial management, supply chain management, order processing, shipping and billing and providing services and support to our customers. additionally, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. a disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations. furthermore, a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. a party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information. actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure. if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. in addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode. gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. in addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. in particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product&rsquo;s life. to offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan. our principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in taiwan. relations between taiwan and the people&rsquo;s republic of china, also referred to as the prc, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares. 26 the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china, including taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland china. the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government. although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc, the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by taiwan. the united states' relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act, which signifies when the u.s. switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc, referred to as the &quot;one-china&quot; policy. deviations from the &quot;one-china&quot; policy could lead to adverse changes in china-u.s. and china-taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future. changes in our united states federal income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater u.s. shareholders. the tax cuts and jobs act (the &ldquo;2017 act&rdquo;) signed on december 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to u.s. shareholders that own, or are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a non-u.s. corporation (a 10% u.s. shareholder) under the u.s. federal income tax law applicable to owners of u.s. controlled foreign corporations (&ldquo;cfcs&rdquo;). prior to the 2017 act, the company did not believe we, or any of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, were considered a cfc, which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10% u.s. shareholders together own, or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a non-u.s. corporation. the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the company&rsquo;s foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10% u.s. shareholder. this may be the result without regard to whether 10% u.s. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules. the repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of cfcs beginning before january 1, 2018 and for the taxable year of 10% u.s. shareholders in which the cfcs' taxable year ends. additional tax consequences to 10% u.s. shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act. for example, the 2017 act amended section 965 to require 10% u.s. shareholders to include in income their pro-rata share of certain earnings and profits (e&amp;p) of cfcs. this section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividends-received deduction. the 2017 act also added section 951a which requires a 10% u.s. shareholder of a cfc to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) of the cfc. finally, the 2017 act eliminated the requirement in section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% u.s. shareholder to have a current income inclusion. from time to time, the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program. these measures could inadvertently create additional 10% u.s. shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above. we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the u.s. federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability. failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business. we have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. for example, faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. to the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. an inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation oem products, our customers&rsquo; ability to sell airplanes. delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified. any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 27 our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel. our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. the loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. for example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business. our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality. our operating results are difficult to predict. our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. if such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. as we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods. if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected. historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. sales of certain of our fitness, outdoor, marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season. in addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations. we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business. because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. in particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted. many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. in the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer. 28 we may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions. we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all. any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management&rsquo;s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. in addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. we may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future. if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed. there is uncertainty as to our shareholders&rsquo; ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan. we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states, particularly in taiwan. as a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us. in addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof. a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business. any failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems (gnss). the global positioning system (gps) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense. the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. however, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years. to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. gps modernization software updates can cause problems. we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates. 29 gps is operated by the u.s. government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps; however, if the policy were to change, and gps were no longer supported by the u.s. government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems (sbas) that augment gps, such as the u.s. wide area augmentation system (waas), japanese mtsat-based satellite augmentation system (msas), and european geostationary navigation overlay service (egnos). any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets. some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system. other countries, including china and india, are in the process of creating their own gnss systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems. the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as galileo. national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position. use of non-us gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue. any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning system-based products instead of products based on competing technologies. our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism. acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the gps signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system. to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors. any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals. this interference could harm our business. our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service (sps) provided by the u.s. government&rsquo;s global positioning system satellites. the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized technical agency of the united nations. these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference. each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. in the united states, the federal communications commission (fcc) and the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations. any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. 30 natural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change could affect our financial results. natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis or earthquakes, could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory. if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and/or if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events, our financial results could be adversely affected. climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change. the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act. at the federal legislative level, congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. it is also possible that the u.s. congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business. because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. risks relating to our shares the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares. the market price of our shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. during 2017, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of $47.35 to a high of $62.92. a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: &middot; new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; &middot; general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates; &middot; announcements of technological innovations; &middot; product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions; &middot; developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers; &middot; the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products; &middot; quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results; &middot; changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates; &middot; developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; &middot; announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete; &middot; research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; &middot; any significant acts of terrorism against the united states, taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products; and &middot; other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks. 31 in addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us. as of january 17, 2018, members of our board of directors, and our executive officers, and gary burrell (our co-founder and former executive officer and member of our board of directors), together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 39.99% of our outstanding shares. accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law. the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd.&rsquo;s articles of association. the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders&rsquo; meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. for example, swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders swiss withholding tax. if we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited. the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration. a u.s. holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). however, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 32 under current swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. however, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax. therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes. no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available. however, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period. we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a &quot;second trading line&quot; on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax. however, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase. we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares has been a component of our capital management and shareholder return practices, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 55 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin&rsquo;s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u.s. dollar. the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks. the currencies that create a majority of the company&rsquo;s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling. garmin corporation, headquartered in xizhi, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. the company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary&rsquo;s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u.s. dollars. most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency. the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary, garmin (europe) ltd. remains the u.s. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows. during fiscal year 2017, the company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $22.6 million, primarily due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the taiwan dollar, partially offset by the u.s. dollar weakening against the euro and the british pound sterling. during fiscal 2017, the u.s. dollar weakened 9.4% against the taiwan dollar, resulting in a loss of $55.9 million, while the u.s. dollar weakened 14.1% against the euro and 9.5% against the british pound sterling, resulting in gains of $27.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. the remaining net currency gain of $3.0 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions. these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2017 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $88.3 million within accumulated other comprehensive income. 55 we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the taiwan dollar, euro, and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $96 million and $92 million at december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016. interest rate risk we have no outstanding long-term debt as of december 30, 2017. we, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk. we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. as interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. the company&rsquo;s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. during 2017 and 2016, the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. we assessed the company&rsquo;s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company&rsquo;s portfolio of marketable securities. based on balance sheet positions as of december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $42 million and $45 million at december 30, 2017 and december 30, 2016, respectively. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity. 56risk factors 22 quantitative and qualitative
