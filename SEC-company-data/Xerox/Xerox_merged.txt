risk factors 18 risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenues are generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to u.s. dollar and japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 18 we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services and/or business process services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products and which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our services and products may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our services and products, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales, the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for our services contracts, we rely to a significant extent on third-party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers; if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third-party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third-party providers do not meet these obligations or our expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. 19 our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to enable us to perform our services under the contracts, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or a reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as, among other things, a customer's or client's merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer's or client's exercise of contract termination rights. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. governments and their agencies may have the right to terminate many of these contracts at any time without cause. these contracts, upon their expiration or termination, are typically subject to a bidding process in which xerox may not be successful. also, our contracts with governmental entities are generally subject to the approval of annual appropriations by the united states congress or other legislative/governing bodies to fund the expenditures of the governmental entities under those contracts. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. our services business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing the ramp-up of new contracts. in order for our services business to continue its growth, we must successfully manage the ramp-up of services related to new contracts. if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a subcontractor, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client ' dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. in particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors. we could also trigger contractual credits to clients or a contractual default. failure to properly transition new clients to our systems, properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance, trigger service level penalties, impair fixed or intangible assets or result in contract profit margins that do not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins. 20 if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. our ability to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers' usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 21 we are subject to united states and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including social security numbers and financial and health information, as well as laws that regulate how we can obtain and use such information. for example, in 1996, congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein, the department of health and human services established regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates. another example is the european union directive on data protection, entitled directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. we have also taken steps to address the requirements of that directive. other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well and additional legislation may be enacted at any time. failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to, among other things, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breach of our security systems. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our, our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 22 our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvement therein, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2012 , we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions of or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third-party manufacturers and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 23 we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages that are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, or the price of color pages declines at a greater rate and faster pace than we anticipate, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law and the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ), as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive ( erp ) is expected to lead to the adoption of implementing measures intended to require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. it is possible that some or all of our products may be required to comply with erp implementing measures. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. 24 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management, in the xerox corporation 2012 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.risk factors 16 risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to u.s. dollar and japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services and/or business process services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products and that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our services and products may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our services contracts are increasingly requiring tighter timelines for implementation as well as more stringent service level metrics. this makes the bidding process for new contracts much more difficult and require us to adequately consider these requirements in the pricing of our services. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2013 annual report 16 in addition, in order to continually meet the service requirements of our customers, which often includes 24/7 service, and to optimize our employee cost base, we will locate our delivery service centers in lower-cost locations, including several developing countries. concentrating our delivery service centers in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control, including the risks of political instability, natural disasters, safety and security risks, labor disruptions and rising labor rates. these risks could impair our ability to effectively provide services to our customers and keep our costs aligned to our associated revenues and market requirements. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our services and products, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. governments and their agencies may have the right to terminate many of these contracts at any time without cause. these contracts, upon their expiration or termination, are typically subject to a bidding process in which xerox may not be successful. also, our contracts with governmental entities are generally subject to the approval of annual appropriations by the united states congress or other legislative/governing bodies to fund the expenditures of the governmental entities under those contracts. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. our ability to deliver services could be impaired if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business, which could result in decreased revenues or additional costs. at times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience. additionally, in regard to the labor-intensive business of the company, quality service and adequate internal controls depend on our ability to retain employees and manage personnel turnover. an increase in the employee turnover rate or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could increase recruiting and training costs and potentially decrease revenues or decrease our operating effectiveness and productivity. we may not be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects. xerox 2013 annual report 17 for our services contracts, we rely to a significant extent on third-party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers; if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third-party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third-party providers do not meet these obligations or our expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to enable us to perform our services under the contracts, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or a reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as, among other things, a customer's or client's merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer's or client's exercise of contract termination rights. our services business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing the start-up of new contracts. in order for our services business to continue its growth, we must successfully manage the start-up of services related to new contracts. if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a subcontractor, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client ' dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client or obtain new work from other potential clients. in particular, clients who are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date, which may result in our inability to fully recover our up-front investments. in addition, clients could direct future business to our competitors. we could also trigger contractual credits to clients or a contractual default. failure to properly transition new clients to our systems, properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance, trigger service level penalties, impair fixed or intangible assets or result in contract profit margins that do not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to xerox 2013 annual report 18 obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. our ability to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix and price of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers' usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service and technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) and the hipaa regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information, and the european union directive on data protection (directive 95/46/ec). other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to our processing of individually identifiable information and these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breach of our security systems and service interruptions which could expose us to liability, impair our reputation or temporarily render us unable to fulfill our service obligations under our contracts. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of xerox 2013 annual report 19 information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement preventative measures. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we also maintain various systems and data centers for our customers. often these systems and data centers must be maintained worldwide and on a 24/7 basis. although we endeavor to ensure that there is adequate back-up and maintenance of these systems and centers, we could experience service interruptions that could result in curtailed operations and loss of customers, which would reduce our revenue and profits in addition to impairing our reputation . our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvement therein, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. xerox 2013 annual report 20 the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2013 , we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and increasingly are relying on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages that are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, or the price of color pages declines at a greater rate and faster pace than we anticipate, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be xerox 2013 annual report 21 subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) is expected to lead to the adoption of implementing measures intended to require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. it is possible that some or all of our products may be required to comply with erp implementing measures. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 13 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2013, the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities in each entity would not be significant because all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2013. a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2013 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $655 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited, fuji xerox and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $6.6 billion at december 31, 2013. xerox 2013 annual report 58 interest rate risk management the consolidated weighted-average interest rates related to our total debt for 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximated 5.0%, 4.7%, and 5.2%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2013, $350 million of our total debt of $8 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2013, a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $96 million. xerox 2013 annual report 59risk factors 13 risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to u.s. dollar and japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2014 annual report 13 our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control act of 2011) or other debt or funding constraints, such as those recently experienced in the united states and europe, could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we inappropriately charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. we derive significant revenue and profit from commercial and federal government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes, including renewals, which can impose substantial costs on us, and we will not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to accurately and effectively bid on such projects. many of these contracts are extremely complex and require the investment of significant resources in order to prepare accurate bids and proposals. competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: (i) the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; (ii) the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design; (iii) the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding, and the risk that such protests or challenges could result in the requirement to resubmit bids, and in the termination, reduction, or modification of the awarded contracts; and (iv) the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue. adverse events or developments in any of these bidding risks and uncertainties could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. for our services contracts, we rely to a significant extent on third-party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers; if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third-party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third-party providers do not meet these obligations or our or our clients' expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. xerox 2014 annual report 14 we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, and demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services and/or business process services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products and that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our services and products may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our services contracts are increasingly requiring tighter timelines for implementation as well as more stringent service level metrics. this makes the bidding process for new contracts much more difficult and requires us to adequately consider these requirements in the pricing of our services. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in order to continually meet the service requirements of our customers, which often includes 24/7 service, and to optimize our employee cost base, we often locate our delivery service centers in lower-cost locations, including several developing countries. concentrating our delivery service centers in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control, including the risks of political instability, natural disasters, safety and security risks, labor disruptions and rising labor rates. these risks could impair our ability to effectively provide services to our customers and keep our costs aligned to our associated revenues and market requirements. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our services and products, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2014 annual report 15 we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service and technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) and the hipaa regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information, and the european union directive on data protection (directive 95/46/ec). other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to our processing of individually identifiable information and these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breaches of our security systems and service interruptions which could expose us to liability, impair our reputation or temporarily render us unable to fulfill our service obligations under our contracts. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we also maintain various systems and data centers for our customers. often these systems and data centers must be maintained worldwide and on a 24/7 basis. although we endeavor to ensure that there is adequate back-up and maintenance of these systems and centers, we could experience service interruptions that could result in curtailed operations and loss of customers, which would reduce our revenue and profits in addition to impairing our reputation . our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to enable us to perform our services under the contracts, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or a reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as a customer's or client's merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer's or client's exercise of contract termination rights. our services business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing the start-up of new contracts. in order for our services business to continue its growth, we must successfully manage the start-up of services related to new contracts. if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a subcontractor, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client ' dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client or obtain new work from other potential clients. in particular, clients who are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date, which may result in xerox 2014 annual report 16 our inability to fully recover our up-front investments. in addition, clients could direct future business to our competitors. we could also trigger contractual credits to clients or a contractual default. failure to properly transition new clients to our systems, properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance, trigger service level penalties, impair fixed or intangible assets or result in contract profit margins that do not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins. in addition, we incur significant expenditures for the development and construction of system software platforms needed to support our clients' needs. our failure to fully understand client requirements or implement the appropriate operating systems or databases or solutions which enable the use of other supporting software may delay the project and result in cost overruns or potential impairment of the related software platforms. if we are unable to collect our receivables for unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. the profitability of certain of our large services contracts depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. actual losses on client balances could differ from current estimates and, as a result, may require adjustment of our receivables for unbilled services. our receivables include long-term contracts and over the course of a long-term contract, our customers' financial condition may change such that their ability to pay their obligations, and our ability to collect our fees for services rendered, is adversely affected. additionally, we may perform work for the federal, state and local governments, with respect to which we must file requests for equitable adjustment or claims with the proper agency to seek recovery in whole or in part, for out-of-scope work directed or caused by the government customer in support of its project, and the amounts of such recoveries may not meet our expectations or cover our costs. macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our clients and, as a result, could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments (for example, achieve specified milestones in percentage-of-completion contracts) and bill and collect our contracted revenues. if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. in addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and increasingly are relying on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. we need to successfully manage changes in the printing environment and market because our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. the printing market and environment is changing significantly as a result of new technologies, shifts in customer preferences in office printing and the expansion of new printing markets. examples include mobile printing, color printing, continuous feed inkjet printing and the expansion of the market for entry products (a4 printers) and high-end products (b1/b2 printers). a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces products and services that meet these changes. our future xerox 2014 annual report 17 success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive technologies, it may negatively impact expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales productivity and expand and successfully manage our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix and price of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placements and an increase in post sale revenues. in addition, with respect to our indirect distribution channels, many of our partners may sell competing products, further increasing the need to successfully manage our relationships with our partners to ensure they meet our specific sale and distribution requirements for equipment placements and post sale revenues. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to deliver services could be impaired if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business, which could result in decreased revenues or additional costs. at times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience. in regard to the labor-intensive business of the company, quality service and adequate internal controls depend on our ability to retain employees and manage personnel turnover. an increase in the employee turnover rate or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could increase recruiting and training costs and potentially decrease revenues or decrease our operating effectiveness and productivity. we may not be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects. additionally, we need to identify managerial personnel in emerging markets and lower-cost locations where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense. if we are unable to develop and retain these managerial employees with leadership capabilities our ability to successfully manage our business units could be impaired. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, the majority of which support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. xerox 2014 annual report 18 we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to the general liquidity of and on-going changes in the credit markets as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2014 , we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or materially increase an existing accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts above any existing accruals, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products in their existing forms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) has led to the adoption of implementing measures or "voluntary agreements" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. a number of our products are already required to comply with erp requirements and further regulations are being developed by the eu authorities. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private xerox 2014 annual report 19 procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 58 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 14 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. xerox 2014 annual report 58 foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2014, the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities in each entity would not be significant because all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2014. a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2014 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $637 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited, fuji xerox and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $6.4 billion at december 31, 2014. interest rate risk management the consolidated weighted-average interest rates related to our total debt for 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximated 4.8%, 5.0%, and 4.7%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2014, $343 million of our total debt of $7.7 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2014, a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $92 million.risk factors 13 risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to u.s. dollar and japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2015 annual report 13 our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control act of 2011) or other debt or funding constraints, such as those recently experienced in the united states and europe, could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we inappropriately charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. the planned separation of our business process outsourcing ( bpo ) business from our document technology and document outsourcing business into two independent, publicly-traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business. on january 29, 2016 we announced that our board of directors approved management's plan to separate our bpo business from our document technology and document outsourcing business. each of the businesses will operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. our objective is to complete the separation by year-end 2016. the separation is subject to customary regulatory approvals, effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, tax considerations, securing any necessary financing and final approval of our board of directors. the transaction is intended to be tax-free for our shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we also announced a three-year strategic cost transformation project targeting incremental savings of $600 million for a cumulative cost reduction of $2.4 billion when combined with savings from on-going programs. there are numerous risks associated with the proposed separation, including, but not limited to, the risk that the proposed separation of the bpo business from the document technology and document outsourcing business will not be consummated within the anticipated time period or at all, including as the result of regulatory, market or other factors the risk of significant additional costs being incurred if the separation is delayed or does not occur at all; the risk of disruption to our business in connection with the proposed separation and that we could lose customers and/or business partners as a result of such disruption the risk that the proposed separation will require significantly more time and attention from our senior management and employees than we currently anticipate, which could distract management from the operation of our business; the risk that we may find it more difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion; the risk that the bpo business and document technology and document outsourcing business do not realize all of the expected benefits of the separation; the risk that, as smaller, independent companies, the bpo business and document technology and document outsourcing business will be less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and well as the risk of takeover by third parties; the risk that the yet-to-be determined credit ratings for the two publicly-traded companies may result in higher funding costs for one or both of the companies; the risk that the separation will not be tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes; the risk that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will not be equal to or greater than what the value of xerox common stock would have been had the separation not occurred; and the risk that the expected amount of cost reductions under the cost transformation program will not be realized. xerox 2015 annual report 14 the potential negative impact of the events described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, whether we are constituted as two independent publicly-traded companies after the proposed separation is completed or as one company as currently constituted. we derive significant revenue and profit from commercial and federal government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes, including renewals, which can impose substantial costs on us, and we will not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to accurately and effectively bid on such projects. many of these contracts are extremely complex and require the investment of significant resources in order to prepare accurate bids and proposals. competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: (i) the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; (ii) the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design; (iii) the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding, and the risk that such protests or challenges could result in the requirement to resubmit bids, and in the termination, reduction, or modification of the awarded contracts; and (iv) the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue. adverse events or developments in any of these bidding risks and uncertainties could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. for our services contracts, we rely to a significant extent on third-party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers; if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third-party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third-party providers do not meet these obligations or our or our clients' expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, and demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services and/or business process services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; remain cost efficient; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products and that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our services and products may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer xerox 2015 annual report 15 resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our services and products, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our services contracts are increasingly requiring tighter timelines for implementation as well as more stringent service level metrics. this makes the bidding process for new contracts much more difficult and requires us to adequately consider these requirements in the pricing of our services. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in order to continually meet the service requirements of our customers, which often includes 24/7 service, and to optimize our employee cost base including our back-office support, we often locate our delivery service and back-office support centers in lower-cost locations, including several developing countries. concentrating our centers in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control, including the risks of political instability, natural disasters, safety and security risks, labor disruptions; excessive employee turnover and rising labor rates. these risks could impair our ability to effectively provide services to our customers and keep our costs aligned to our associated revenues and market requirements. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our services and products, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service and technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) and the hipaa regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information, and the european union directive on data protection (directive 95/46/ec). other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to our processing of individually identifiable information and these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. for example, the recent invalidation of the u.s.-eu safe harbor regime will require us to implement alternative mechanisms in order for some of our data flows from europe to the united states to comply with applicable law. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breaches of our security systems and service interruptions which could expose us to liability, impair our reputation or temporarily render us unable to fulfill our service obligations under our contracts. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. because the techniques used to obtain xerox 2015 annual report 16 unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we also maintain various systems and data centers for our customers. often these systems and data centers must be maintained worldwide and on a 24/7 basis. although we endeavor to ensure that there is adequate back-up and maintenance of these systems and centers, we could experience service interruptions that could result in curtailed operations and loss of customers, which would reduce our revenue and profits in addition to impairing our reputation . our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to enable us to perform our services under the contracts, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or a reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as a customer's or client's merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer's or client's exercise of contract termination rights. our services business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing the start-up of new contracts. in order for our services business to continue its growth, we must successfully manage the start-up of services related to new contracts. if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a subcontractor, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client ' dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client or obtain new work from other potential clients. in particular, clients who are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date, which may result in our inability to fully recover our up-front investments. in addition, clients could direct future business to our competitors. we could also trigger contractual credits to clients or a contractual default. failure to properly transition new clients to our systems, properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance, trigger service level penalties, impair fixed or intangible assets or result in contract profit margins that do not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins. in addition, we incur significant expenditures for the development and construction of system software platforms needed to support our clients' needs. our failure to fully understand client requirements or implement the appropriate operating systems or databases or solutions which enable the use of other supporting software may delay the project and result in cost overruns or potential impairment of the related software platforms. if we are unable to collect our receivables for unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. the profitability of certain of our large services contracts depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. actual losses on client balances could differ from current estimates and, as a result, may require adjustment of our receivables for unbilled services. our receivables include long-term contracts and over the course of a long-term contract, our customers' financial condition may change such that their ability to pay their obligations, and our ability to collect our fees for services rendered, is adversely affected. additionally, we may perform work for the federal, state and local governments, with respect to which we must file requests for equitable adjustment or claims with the proper agency to seek recovery in whole or in part, for out-of-scope work directed or caused by the government customer in support of its project, and the amounts of such recoveries may not meet our expectations or cover our costs. macroeconomic conditions could result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our clients and, as a result, could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments (for example, achieve specified milestones in percentage-of-completion contracts) and bill and collect our contracted revenues. if we are unable to meet our xerox 2015 annual report 17 contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. in addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and increasingly are relying on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. we need to successfully manage changes in the printing environment and market because our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. the printing market and environment is changing significantly as a result of new technologies, shifts in customer preferences in office printing and the expansion of new printing markets. examples include mobile printing, color printing, continuous feed inkjet printing and the expansion of the market for entry products (a4 printers) and high-end products (b1/b2 printers). a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces products and services that meet these changes. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive technologies, it may negatively impact expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales productivity and expand and successfully manage our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix and price of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placements and an increase in post sale revenues. in addition, with respect to our indirect distribution channels, many of our partners may sell competing products, further increasing the need to successfully manage our relationships with our partners to ensure they meet our specific sale and distribution requirements for equipment placements and post sale revenues. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of xerox 2015 annual report 18 finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to deliver services could be impaired if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business, which could result in decreased revenues or additional costs. at times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience. in regard to the labor-intensive business of the company, quality service and adequate internal controls depend on our ability to retain employees and manage personnel turnover. an increase in the employee turnover rate or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could increase recruiting and training costs and potentially decrease revenues or decrease our operating effectiveness and productivity. we may not be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects. additionally, we need to identify managerial personnel in emerging markets and lower-cost locations where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense. if we are unable to develop and retain these managerial employees with leadership capabilities our ability to successfully manage our business units could be impaired. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, the majority of which support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to the general liquidity of and on-going changes in the credit markets as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2015 , we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to xerox 2015 annual report 19 recognize a material accrual or materially increase an existing accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts above any existing accruals, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products in their existing forms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) has led to the adoption of implementing measures or "voluntary agreements" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. a number of our products are already required to comply with erp requirements and further regulations are being developed by the eu authorities. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar, epeat) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 61 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 14 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2015 , the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities in each entity would not be significant because all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2015 . a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2015 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $557 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited, fuji xerox and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $5.6 billion at december 31, 2015 . xerox 2015 annual report 61 interest rate risk management the consolidated weighted-average interest rates related to our total debt for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 approximated 4.7%, 4.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2015 , $338 million of our total debt of $7.4 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2015 , a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $115 million.risk factors 8 risk factors if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited. we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the declines in installations and printed pages, fewer devices per location and an increase in electronic documentation. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models. these market and competitive trends make it difficult to reverse the current declines in revenue over the past several years. a third set of challenges relates to our continued efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity in light of declining revenues. in addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete, as well as, the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate. if we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to the u.s. dollar and euro and the pound sterling and euro to the u.s. dollar - as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2016 annual report 8 we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate in over 160 countries and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) are involved in much of the coordinated activity, although the timing and methods of implementation vary. additionally, comprehensive us tax reform has been stated to be a priority for the us congress and new administration. such changes in tax laws or their interpretation, if adopted, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must work with our supply partners and make certain investments and commit resources before knowing whether these initiatives will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control act of 2011) or other debt or funding constraints could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we inappropriately charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete xerox 2016 annual report 9 for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, and demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors include large international companies some of which have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; remain cost efficient; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as strategic transformation program, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information. these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. xerox 2016 annual report 10 we are subject to breaches of our security systems, cyber attacks and service interruptions which could expose us to liability, litigation, and regulatory action and impair our reputation. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining and protecting our own, and our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information, including information related to identifiable individuals, against unauthorized access or disclosure. despite such efforts, we may be subject to breaches of our security systems resulting in unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems and the information we are trying to protect. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing, are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until after an exploitation of information has occurred. therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. unauthorized access to our facilities or electronic information systems, or those of our suppliers, or accidental loss or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information about us, our clients or our customers could result in, among other things, a total shutdown of our systems that would disrupt our ability to conduct business or pay vendors and employees, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in performing or marketing our services, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect this information and our infrastructure. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and increasingly are relying on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. we need to successfully manage changes in the printing environment and market because our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. the printing market and environment is changing as a result of new technologies, shifts in customer preferences in office printing and the expansion of new printing markets. examples include mobile printing, color printing, packaging, print on objects, continuous feed inkjet printing and the expansion of the market for entry products (a4 printers) and high-end products. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces products and services that meet these changes. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive technologies, it may negatively impact expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be improved through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales efficiency and expand and successfully manage our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to preserve our post sale revenue streams is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix and price of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. there will be a lag xerox 2016 annual report 11 between the increase in equipment placements and an increase in post-sale revenues. in addition, with respect to our indirect distribution channels, many of our partners may sell competing products, further increasing the need to successfully manage our relationships with our partners to ensure they meet our specific sale and distribution requirements for equipment placements and post sale revenues. if we are unable to maintain a consistent level of revenue, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings, which is currently investment grade, and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. our ability to provide customer financing is a significant competitive advantage. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, the majority of which support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee benefit - related funding requirements . we sponsor several defined benefit pension and retiree-health benefit plans throughout the world. we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans. although most of our major defined benefit plans have been amended to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, the projected benefit obligations under these benefit plans is measured annually and at december 31, 2016 exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately $2.2 billion. the current underfunded status of these plans is a significant factor in determining the ongoing future contributions we will be required to make to these plans. accordingly, we expect to have additional funding requirements in future years and we may make additional, voluntary contributions to the plans. depending on our cash position at the time, any such funding or contributions to our defined benefit plans could impact our operating flexibility and financial position, including adversely affecting our cash flow for the quarter in which such funding or contributions are made. weak economic conditions and related under-performance of asset markets could also lead to increases in our funding requirements . we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to the general liquidity of and on-going changes in the credit markets as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. xerox 2016 annual report 12 the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2016, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or materially increase an existing accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts above any existing accruals, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries. our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the u.s. the activities of these entities may not comply with u.s. laws or business practices or our code of business conduct. violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted, or are expected to adopt, restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. recently, a number of studies have been published by third parties regarding chemicals utilized in our industry, as well as potential health/safety impacts of machine emissions. additional studies are planned, and depending on the results of such studies, regulatory initiatives could follow. xerox is monitoring these developments. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products in their existing forms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) has led to the adoption of implementing measures or "voluntary agreements" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. a number of our products are already required to comply with erp requirements and further regulations are being developed by the eu authorities. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach and similar regulatory programs in other jurisdictions could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. in the united states, the toxics substances control act xerox 2016 annual report 13 ( tsca ) is undergoing a major overhaul with similar potential for regulatory challenges. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar, epeat) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. for example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries, states and territories in which we operate. enacted laws and/or regulatory actions to address concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could negatively impact our business, including the availability of our products or the cost to obtain or sell those products. the separation of our business process outsourcing ( bpo ) business from our document technology and document outsourcing business into two independent, publicly-traded companies may not yield the expected benefits. the separation of our bpo business from our document technology and document outsourcing business into two independent, publicly-traded companies was completed on december 31, 2016. the company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. the expected increased focus of management exclusively on the company's own business and its distinct needs, may not yield expected long-term growth and profitability. in addition, the separation has resulted in the company becoming a smaller, less diversified enterprise with a narrower market focus, which could make it more vulnerable to changing market conditions and other adverse events. further, although we have received an opinion from outside counsel as to the tax-free nature of the separation, there can be no assurance that the united states internal revenue service will not challenge this position or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. the potential negative impact of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 14 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2016 , it would not significantly change the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2016 . a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2016 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $484 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited, fuji xerox and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $4.8 billion at december 31, 2016 . xerox 2016 annual report 49 interest rate risk management the consolidated average interest rate associated with our total debt for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 approximated 4.7%, 4.8%, and 4.9%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. the average interest rate for 2016 excludes interest associated with the $1.0 billion term loan facility that was required to be repaid upon completion of the separation and therefore was reported in discontinued operations in 2016. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2016 , $332 million of our total debt of $6.3 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2016 , a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $89 million.risk factors 8 risk factors if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited. we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the declines in installations and printed pages, fewer devices per location and an increase in electronic documentation. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models. these market and competitive trends make it difficult to reverse the current declines in revenue over the past several years. a third set of challenges relates to our continued efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity in light of declining revenues. in addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete, as well as, the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate. if we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economic and political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations, and we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen, the euro and the british pound - as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in local economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax regulations and other related legal matters. we use currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions. this practice is intended to mitigate or reduce volatility in the results of our foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate it. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic or political conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2017 annual report 8 we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate in approximately 160 countries and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) are involved in much of the coordinated activity, although the timing and methods of implementation vary. additionally, the u.s. government recently enacted comprehensive tax reform in december of 2017 through the passage and signing of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system. the exact ramifications of the legislation is subject to interpretation and could have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations. although our 2017 results of operations reflect our best estimate of the impact of the new tax law, future regulatory direction associated with the new tax law as well as new legislative developments could adversely affect our future effective tax rate and results. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must work with our supply partners and commit resources before knowing whether these initiatives will result in products that are commercially successful and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. it is possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. also, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control act of 2011) or other debt or funding constraints, could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. additionally, government agencies routinely audit government contracts. if the government finds that we inappropriately charged costs to a contract, the costs will be non-reimbursable or, to the extent reimbursed, refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits or, investigations could have an adverse effect on our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. xerox 2017 annual report 9 we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, and demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors include large international companies some of which have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our future success is largely dependent upon our ability to compete in the markets we currently serve, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; remain cost efficient; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and such loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from current levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as the strategic transformation program, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information. these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. for example, the general data protection regulation will come into force in the european union in may 2018. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breaches of our security systems, cyber attacks and service interruptions which could expose us to liability, litigation, and regulatory action and damage our reputation. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining and protecting our own, and our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information, including information related to identifiable individuals, against unauthorized access or disclosure. despite such efforts, we may be subject to breaches of our security systems resulting in unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems and the information we are trying to protect. xerox 2017 annual report 10 moreover, the risk of such attacks includes attempted breeches not only of our systems, but also those of our customers, clients and suppliers. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing, are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until after an exploitation of information has occurred. therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems, or those of our suppliers, or accidental loss or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information about us, our clients or our customers could result in, among other things, a total shutdown of our systems that would disrupt our ability to conduct business or pay vendors and employees. in the event of such actions, we could be exposed to unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. while from time to time attempts are made to access our systems, these attempts have not resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our systems. we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect this information and our infrastructure. we have outsourced a significant portion of our manufacturing operations and increasingly rely on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our manufacturing operations to third parties. we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, quickly respond to changes in customer demand, and obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process. in addition, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. we need to successfully manage changes in the printing environment and market because our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. the printing market and environment is changing as a result of new technologies, shifts in customer preferences in office printing and the expansion of new printing markets. examples include mobile printing, color printing, packaging, print on objects, continuous feed inkjet printing and the expansion of the market for entry products (a4 printers) and high-end products. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces products and services that meet these changes. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive technologies, it may negatively impact expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be improved through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales efficiency and expand and successfully manage our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to preserve our post sale revenue streams is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix and price of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placements and an increase in post-sale revenues. in addition, with respect to our indirect distribution channels, many of our partners sell competing products, further increasing the need to successfully manage our relationships with our partners to ensure they meet our specific sale and distribution requirements for equipment placements and post sale revenues. if we are unable to maintain a consistent level of revenue, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2017 annual report 11 our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit rating, which is currently investment grade, and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. our ability to provide customer financing is a significant competitive advantage. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, the majority of which support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee benefit - related funding requirements . we sponsor several defined benefit pension and retiree-health benefit plans throughout the world. we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans. although most of our major defined benefit plans have been amended to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, the projected benefit obligations under these benefit plans is measured annually and at december 31, 2017 exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately $1.4 billion. the current underfunded status of these plans is a significant factor in determining the ongoing future contributions we will be required to make to these plans. accordingly, we expect to have additional funding requirements in future years and we may make additional, voluntary contributions to the plans. depending on our cash position at the time, any such funding or contributions to our defined benefit plans could impact our operating flexibility and financial position, including adversely affecting our cash flow for the quarter in which such funding or contributions are made. weak economic conditions and related under-performance of asset markets could also lead to increases in our funding requirements . we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward subject to the general liquidity of and on-going changes in the credit markets as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. our $1.8 billion credit facility (the "credit facility") contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2017, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2017 annual report 12 our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or materially increase an existing accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts above any existing accruals, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries. our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the u.s. the activities of these entities may not comply with u.s. laws or business practices or our code of business conduct. violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted, or are expected to adopt, restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. recently, a number of studies have been published by third parties regarding chemicals utilized in our industry, as well as potential health/safety impacts of machine emissions. additional studies are planned, and depending on the results of such studies, regulatory initiatives could follow. we are monitoring these developments. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products in their existing forms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related-programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) has led to the adoption of implementing measures or "voluntary agreements" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. a number of our products are already required to comply with erp requirements and further regulations are being developed by the eu authorities. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach and similar regulatory programs in other jurisdictions could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. in the united states, the toxics substances control act ( tsca ) is undergoing a major overhaul with similar potential for regulatory challenges. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the xerox 2017 annual report 13 marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar, epeat) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. for example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries, states and territories in which we operate. enacted laws and/or regulatory actions to address concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could negatively impact our business, including the availability of our products or the cost to obtain or sell those products. the separation of our business process outsourcing ( bpo ) business from our document technology and document outsourcing business into two independent, publicly-traded companies may not yield the expected benefits. the separation of our bpo business from our document technology and document outsourcing business into two independent, publicly-traded companies was completed on december 31, 2016. the company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. the expected increased focus of management exclusively on the company's own business and its distinct needs, may not yield expected long-term growth and profitability. in addition, the separation has resulted in the company becoming a smaller, less diversified enterprise with a narrower market focus, which could make it more vulnerable to changing market conditions and other adverse events. further, although we have received an opinion from outside counsel as to the tax-free nature of the separation, there can be no assurance that the united states internal revenue service will not challenge this position or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. the potential negative impact of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. our business and reputation could be negatively affected as a result of activist shareholders. certain of our shareholders have expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that may not be fully aligned with our own. responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. these actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. risk factors related to the fujifilm transactions our expectations regarding our business may be impacted by the following risk factors related to the pending fujifilm transactions: the pendency of the fujifilm transactions could adversely affect our business. in connection with the fujifilm transactions, some of our suppliers and customers may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the fujifilm transactions are completed. we have agreed in the fujifilm transaction agreements to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs during the pendency of the fujifilm transactions, which restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the fujifilm transactions is delayed and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business before completion of the fujifilm transactions or termination of the fujifilm transaction agreements. the process of seeking to accomplish the fujifilm transactions could also divert the focus of our management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us. the pursuit of the fujifilm transactions and the preparation for the integration of xerox and fuji xerox have placed, and will continue to place, a significant burden on our management and internal resources. there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of seeking to close the fujifilm transactions and integrate xerox and fuji xerox, which could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our existing business, regardless of whether the fujifilm transactions are eventually completed. our management team will be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing businesses, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products, services or strategies. one potential consequence of such distractions could be the failure of management to realize other strategic opportunities that could be beneficial to us. if our senior management is not able to effectively manage the process leading up to and immediately following closing, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, then our business could suffer. xerox 2017 annual report 14 we may be unable to attract and retain key employees during the pendency of the fujifilm transactions. in connection with the fujifilm transactions, current and prospective employees of xerox may experience uncertainty about their future roles with new fuji xerox following the fujifilm transactions, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the fujifilm transactions. key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with new fuji xerox following the fujifilm transactions. the departure of existing key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept employment with new fuji xerox, despite our recruiting efforts, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results, regardless of whether the fujifilm transactions are eventually completed. the fujifilm transactions may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, and failure to complete the fujifilm transactions may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations. the fujifilm transactions are subject to several closing conditions, including (i) the absence of any law or order issued or enacted by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction in which any of xerox, fuji xerox or their respective subsidiaries has material operations, which enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the fujifilm transactions; (ii) the approval by our shareholders of (a) the issuance; (b) the issuance of certain true-up shares to fujifilm pursuant to the terms set forth in the subscription agreement; and (c) the certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation (collectively, the applicable shareholder approvals ), (iii) expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, and under any other applicable antitrust, competition, trade regulation or merger control law, (iv) the filing of notices and receipt of applicable national security approvals, including with respect to the committee on foreign investment in the united states, the u.s. department of defense's defense security service, the department of energy and the u.s. state department directorate of defense trade controls pursuant to the international traffic in arms regulations and (v) xerox's declaration of the special dividend. the closing conditions also include the delivery to us of the audited financial statements and interim financial statements of fuji xerox for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2016, march 31, 2017 and march 31, 2018 that (x) are gaap compliant, (y) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of fuji xerox and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the interim financial statements of fuji xerox and (z) do not deviate, in any material respect, from the unaudited financial statements of fuji xerox and its subsidiaries provided to us prior to the date of the fujifilm transaction agreements. if any one of these conditions is not satisfied or waived, the fujifilm transactions may not be completed. there is no assurance that the fujifilm transactions will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. the parties have not yet obtained all regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the fujifilm transactions. governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge the fujifilm transactions or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the fujifilm transactions. these restrictions could include a requirement to sell or hold separate certain specified businesses to obtain such regulatory approvals. if these approvals are not received, then neither we nor fujifilm will be obligated to complete the fujifilm transactions. if the applicable shareholder approvals are not obtained or if the fujifilm transactions are not completed for any other reason, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: we and our shareholders would not realize the anticipated benefits of the fujifilm transactions, including payment of the special dividend to holders of our common stock as of the applicable record date and any expected synergies and operating efficiencies from the fujifilm transactions; the attention of our management may have been diverted to the fujifilm transactions instead of on our ongoing business operations and pursuit of other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; resulting negative reactions from our customers, regulators and employees; we may be required to pay a termination fee of $183 million (the termination fee ) if the fujifilm transaction agreements are terminated in the case of certain events described in the fujifilm transaction agreements, including due to an adverse change in our board of directors' recommendation to our shareholders to approve the fujifilm transactions; xerox 2017 annual report 15 we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed fujifilm transactions, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the fujifilm transactions are not completed. many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the fujifilm transactions are not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the fujifilm transactions; resulting negative reactions from the financial markets, including a decline in our stock price (which may reflect a market assumption that the fujifilm transactions will be completed); or xerox could be subject to litigation from shareholders related to the fujifilm transaction agreements. the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. even if the fujifilm transactions close, the integration of xerox and fuji xerox following the closing will present significant challenges that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the fujifilm transactions. historically, xerox and fuji xerox have operated as independent companies, and they will continue to do so until the completion of the fujifilm transactions. there can be no assurance that their businesses can be integrated successfully. new fuji xerox will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the fujifilm transactions, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of xerox and fuji xerox in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the fujifilm transactions: the potential inability (i) to successfully integrate the two businesses, including operations, technologies, products, customer services and offerings and corporate functions and/or (ii) to identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming functions and assets, in a manner that permits new fuji xerox to achieve the synergies and operating efficiencies expected to result from the fujifilm transactions, which could result in the expected benefits of the fujifilm transactions not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; consolidating and rationalizing the companies' information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures as well as accounting systems; integrating the companies' financial reporting and internal control systems, including compliance by new fuji xerox with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the u.s. securities and exchange commission; coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities; integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds, business cultures and management philosophies, while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services; maintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers and vendors; coordinating distribution and marketing efforts; lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two businesses deciding not to do business with new fuji xerox, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company; preserving important relationships of both xerox and fuji xerox and resolving potential conflicts that may arise; performance shortfalls at one or both of xerox and fuji xerox as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the fujifilm transactions and integrating the two businesses' operations; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the fujifilm transactions; and effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals. xerox 2017 annual report 16 combining the businesses of xerox and fuji xerox may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect new fuji xerox's results and negatively affect the value of its common stock following the fujifilm transactions. xerox and fuji xerox have entered into the fujifilm transaction agreements because each believes that the fujifilm transactions will be beneficial to its respective companies and shareholders and that combining the businesses of xerox and fuji xerox will produce benefits and cost savings. if new fuji xerox is not able to successfully combine the businesses of xerox and fuji xerox in an efficient and effective manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the fujifilm transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of new fuji xerox common stock may be affected adversely. an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the fujifilm transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the fujifilm transaction agreements, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of new fuji xerox, which may adversely affect the value of new fuji xerox common stock following the fujifilm transactions. in addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what new fuji xerox expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. if new fuji xerox is not able to adequately address integration challenges, it may be unable to successfully integrate xerox's and fuji xerox's operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies. we may not realize the anticipated synergies, net cost reductions and growth opportunities from the fujifilm transactions. the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the fujifilm transactions will depend, in part, on the ability of new fuji xerox to realize anticipated growth opportunities, net cost reductions and synergies. our success in realizing these growth opportunities, net cost reductions and synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of our historical business and operations and the historical business and operations of fuji xerox. even if we are able to integrate the businesses and operations of xerox and fuji xerox successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities, net cost reductions and synergies that we currently expect from this integration within the anticipated time frame or at all. for example, we may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs. moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of our business and fuji xerox's business. while we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. accordingly, the benefits from the transactions may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the businesses. in connection with the fujifilm transactions, we are acquiring entities that may have potential liabilities, including entities that have previously undergone a financial audit. in connection with the fujifilm transactions, we are acquiring entities that may have potential liabilities relating to their businesses, including entities for which audited financial statements have not yet been provided. in addition, as previously disclosed, fujifilm previously formed an independent investigation committee to conduct a review of the accounting practices at fuji xerox's new zealand subsidiary and at other subsidiaries that identified aggregate adjustments to fuji xerox's financial statements of approximately jpy 40 billion, which primarily related to misstatements at fuji xerox's new zealand and australian subsidiaries as well as certain other adjustments. while fujifilm and fuji xerox continue to review fujifilm's oversight and governance of fuji xerox as well as fuji xerox's oversight and governance over its businesses in light of the findings of the independent investigation committee, there may be governmental investigations and additional consequences related thereto. to the extent we have not identified such liabilities or miscalculated their potential financial impact, these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. following the completion of the fujifilm transactions, new fuji xerox will be controlled by fujifilm. the interests of fujifilm may differ from the interests of other shareholders. immediately following closing, fujifilm is expected to own approximately 50.1 percent of the fully diluted capital stock of new fuji xerox and xerox shareholders are expected to own approximately 49.9 percent. pursuant to the shareholders agreement, the board of directors of new fuji xerox will have twelve directors, which will initially be composed of seven individuals designated by fujifilm and five individuals from among the members of the board of directors of xerox immediately prior to closing designated by xerox in consultation with and subject to reasonable approved by fujifilm. as a result of fujifilm's ownership of a majority of the voting power of common stock, new fuji xerox will be a controlled company as defined in nyse listing rules and will, therefore, not be subject to nyse requirements that would otherwise require new fuji xerox to have (i) a majority of independent xerox 2017 annual report 17 directors, (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors, (iii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors, and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended to the board of directors by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. fujifilm may have different interests than other holders of common stock and may make decisions adverse to your interests. subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in the shareholders agreement, fujifilm would have control over matters submitted to the shareholders that require the affirmative vote of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of new fuji xerox. this concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire common stock and, as a result, might harm the market price of that common stock. given fujifilm's ownership of the majority of the common stock of new fuji xerox and the interactions that will take place between new fuji xerox and fujifilm, the success of new fuji xerox will depend in part on the reputation and success of fujifilm. the fujifilm transaction agreements contain provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us. the fujifilm transaction agreements contain provisions that may discourage third parties from submitting business combination proposals to us that might result in greater value to our shareholders than the fujifilm transactions. the fujifilm transaction agreements generally prohibit us from soliciting, initiating and facilitating or encouraging any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative acquisition proposal from any third party. this provision prevents us from seeking offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the fujifilm transactions. in addition, if the fujifilm transaction agreements are terminated by us or fujifilm in circumstances that obligate us to pay a termination fee, our financial condition may be adversely affected as a result of the payment of the termination fee, which might deter third parties from proposing alternative business combination proposals. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 59 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 15 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2017 , it would not significantly change the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2017 . a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2017 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $411 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited, fuji xerox and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $4.1 billion at december 31, 2017 . interest rate risk management the consolidated average interest rate associated with our total debt for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 approximated 4.6%, 4.7%, and 4.8%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. the average interest rate for 2016 excludes interest associated with the $1.0 billion term loan facility that was required to be repaid upon completion of the separation and therefore was reported in discontinued operations in 2016. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2017 , $325 million of our total debt of $5.5 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2017 , a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $93 million.risk factors 9 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information included, and risks described, in other sections of this form 10-k, including under the headings cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements , legal proceedings , selected financial data , and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. the selected risks described below, however, are not the only risks facing us. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited. we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the declines in installations and printed pages, fewer devices per location and an increase in electronic documentation. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models. these market and competitive trends make it difficult to reverse the current declines in revenue over the past several years. a third set of challenges relates to our continued efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity in light of declining revenues. in addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete, as well as, the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate. if we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business. we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel while our business model undergoes significant changes. xerox is undergoing significant changes in our business model and, accordingly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future. our success is dependent, among other things, on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified senior management and other key employees. competition for key personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. the departure of existing key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept employment with xerox, despite our recruiting efforts, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economic and political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations, and we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen, the euro and the british pound - as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in local economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax regulations and other related legal matters. we use currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions. this practice is intended to mitigate or reduce volatility in the results of our foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate it. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic or political conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. tariffs or other restrictions on foreign imports could negatively impact our financial performance. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by a potential increase in the cost of our products as a result of new or incremental trade protection measures such as, increased import tariffs, import or export restrictions and requirements and the revocation or material modification of trade agreements. changes in u.s. and international trade policy and resultant retaliatory countermeasures, including imposition of increased tariffs, quotas or duties by affected countries, and trading partners are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business. the u.s. government has and could in the future impose trade barriers including tariffs, quotas, duties or other restrictions on foreign imports. the implementation of a border tax, tariff or higher customs duties on our products xerox 2018 annual report 9 table of contents manufactured abroad or components that we import into the u.s., or any potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business, could negatively impact our financial performance. we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate in approximately 160 countries and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) are involved in much of the coordinated activity, although the timing and methods of implementation vary. additionally, the u.s. government recently enacted comprehensive tax reform in december of 2017 through the passage and signing of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system. the exact ramifications of the legislation is subject to interpretation and could have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations. although our 2018 and 2017 results of operations reflect our best estimate of the impact of the new tax law, future regulatory direction associated with the new tax law as well as new legislative developments could adversely affect our future effective tax rate and results. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must work with our supply partners and commit resources before knowing whether these initiatives will result in products that are commercially successful and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. it is possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. also, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control act of 2011) or other debt or funding constraints, could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. additionally, government agencies routinely audit government contracts. if the government finds that we inappropriately charged costs to a contract, the costs will be non-reimbursable or, to the extent reimbursed, refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such xerox 2018 annual report 10 table of contents audits or, investigations could have an adverse effect on our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, and demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors include large international companies some of which have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our future success is largely dependent upon our ability to compete in the markets we currently serve, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; remain cost efficient; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and such loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from current levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior cost reduction actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as project own it, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business. we engage in restructuring actions, including project own it, as well as other transformation efforts in order to reduce our cost structure, realign it to the changing nature of our business and achieve operating efficiencies. in addition, these actions are expected to simplify our organizational structure, upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes. we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring actions. additionally, as a result of our restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. transformation and restructuring may require a significant amount of time and focus from both management and other employees, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. as part of our efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs, we have offshored and outsourced certain of our operations, services and other functions and we will continue to evaluate additional offshoring or outsourcing possibilities. if our outsourcing partners or operations fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels or if we are unable to attract or retain sufficient personnel with the necessary skill sets to meet our xerox 2018 annual report 11 table of contents offshoring needs, the quality of our services, products and operations, as well as our reputation, could suffer. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage these potential issues which could be largely outside of our control. in addition, much of our offshoring takes place in developing countries and as a result may also be subject to geopolitical uncertainty. diminished service quality from offshoring and outsourcing could have an adverse material impact to our operating results due to service interruptions and negative customer reactions. we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information. these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. for example, the general data protection regulation that came into force in the european union in may 2018. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breaches of our security systems, cyber attacks and service interruptions which could expose us to liability, litigation, and regulatory action and damage our reputation. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining and protecting our own, and our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information, including information related to identifiable individuals, against unauthorized access or disclosure. despite such efforts, we may be subject to breaches of our security systems resulting in unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems and the information we are trying to protect. moreover, the risk of such attacks includes attempted breaches not only of our systems, but also those of our customers, clients and suppliers. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing, are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until after an exploitation of information has occurred. therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems, or those of our suppliers, or accidental loss or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information about us, our clients or our customers could result in, among other things, a total shutdown of our systems that would disrupt our ability to conduct business or pay vendors and employees. in the event of such actions, we could be exposed to unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. while from time to time attempts are made to access our systems, these attempts have not resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our systems. we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect this information and our infrastructure. we have outsourced a significant portion of our manufacturing operations and increasingly rely on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our manufacturing operations to third parties, such as fuji xerox co., ltd. we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, quickly respond to changes in customer demand, and obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process. in addition, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and lead to higher prices for our products and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. xerox 2018 annual report 12 table of contents we need to successfully manage changes in the printing environment and market because our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. the printing market and environment is changing as a result of new technologies, shifts in customer preferences in printing and the expansion of new printing markets as well as ancillary markets. the process of developing new high-technology products, software, services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. examples include mobile printing, color printing, packaging, print on objects, continuous feed inkjet printing and the expansion of the market for entry products (a4 printers) and high-end products as well as electronic delivery, and cloud-based computing and software. these changing market trends are also opening up new ancillary markets for our products, services and software. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces products, services and software that meet these changes. we expect that revenue growth can be improved through improvements in the software features of our multifunction devices, increases in the color printer through expansion to metallic, fluorescent, and clear ink and digital packaging, and leveraging a strong base in managed print services with new digital, analytics, security features. our software strategy involves software for integrated solutions and delivery of industry-focused services into an existing customer base. we also expect to extend our presence in the small and medium sized business market through organic and inorganic investments as well as further expansion into channels and ecommerce and invest in innovation including digital packaging, artificial intelligence, workflow, 3d printing, and iot sensors and services. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market. despite this investment, the process of developing new products or technologies is inherently complex and uncertain and there are a number of risks that we are subject to including the risk that our products or technologies will successfully satisfy our customers' needs or gain market acceptance . if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive technologies, it may negatively impact our future revenue growth and market share as well as our planned expansion into new or alternative markets. additionally, it may negatively impact expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction system. if we are unable to maintain a consistent level of revenue, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit rating, which is currently non-investment grade, and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, or find an economic alternative, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. our ability to provide customer financing is a significant competitive advantage. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, the majority of which support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. xerox 2018 annual report 13 table of contents our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee benefit - related funding requirements . we sponsor several defined benefit pension and retiree-health benefit plans throughout the world. we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans. although most of our major defined benefit plans have been amended to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, the projected benefit obligations under these benefit plans is measured annually and at december 31, 2018 exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately $1.2 billion. the current underfunded status of these plans is a significant factor in determining the ongoing future contributions we will be required to make to these plans. accordingly, we expect to have additional funding requirements in future years and we may make additional, voluntary contributions to the plans. depending on our cash position at the time, any such funding or contributions to our defined benefit plans could impact our operating flexibility and financial position, including adversely affecting our cash flow for the quarter in which such funding or contributions are made. weak economic conditions and related under-performance of asset markets could also lead to increases in our funding requirements . we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward subject to the general liquidity of and on-going changes in the credit markets as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. our $1.8 billion credit facility (the "credit facility") contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2018, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or materially increase an existing accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts above any existing accruals, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries. our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the u.s. the activities of these entities may not comply with u.s. laws or business practices or our code of business conduct. violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. xerox is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by u.s. or state environmental agencies under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act xerox 2018 annual report 14 table of contents ("cercla"), known as "superfund," or state laws. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted, or are expected to adopt, restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. recently, a number of studies have been published by third parties regarding chemicals utilized in our industry, as well as potential health/safety impacts of machine emissions. additional studies are planned, and depending on the results of such studies, regulatory initiatives could follow. we are monitoring these developments. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products in their existing forms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally related-programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) has led to the adoption of implementing measures or "voluntary agreements" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. a number of our products are already required to comply with erp requirements and further regulations are being developed by the eu authorities. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach and similar regulatory programs in other jurisdictions could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. in the united states, the toxics substances control act ( tsca ) is undergoing a major overhaul with similar potential for regulatory challenges. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar, epeat) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. for example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries, states and territories in which we operate. enacted laws and/or regulatory actions to address concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could negatively impact our business, including the availability of our products or the cost to obtain or sell those products. the vote by the united kingdom to leave the eu could adversely affect us. the june 2016 united kingdom referendum on its membership in the eu resulted in a majority of united kingdom voters voting to exit the eu (brexit). we have operations and customers in the united kingdom and the eu, and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may follow brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the united kingdom as well as potential for disruptions in our supply chain in the united kingdom. brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. for example, depending on the terms of brexit, the united kingdom could also lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members. disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our products and services. any of these effects of brexit, and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 15 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2018 , it would not significantly change the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2018 . a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2018 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $419 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited, fuji xerox and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $4.2 billion at december 31, 2018 . interest rate risk management the consolidated average interest rate associated with our total debt for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 approximated 4.6%, 4.6%, and 4.7%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. the average interest rate for 2016 excludes interest associated with the $1.0 billion term loan facility that was required to be repaid upon completion of the separation and therefore was reported in discontinued operations in 2016. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2018 , $301 million of our total debt of $5.2 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, which we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2018 , a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $96 million.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management, in the xerox corporation 2003 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management , in the xerox corporation 2004 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.risk factors we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and 10 customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, services, and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages which are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our continuing success in this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if we fail to successfully develop new products and technologies, we may be unable to retain and gain customers and our revenues would be reduced. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers needs through the development of new products or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. since 2000, we have engaged in a series of restructuring programs related to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, outsourcing some internal functions and engaging in other actions designed to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from the restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of our equipment sales to high-end as opposed to low-end equipment, the trend in our post-sale revenue growth, and, our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve productivity 11 improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our current credit ratings result in higher borrowing costs, which in turn may affect our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings. our access to the public debt markets could be limited to the non-investment grade segment, which results in higher borrowing costs, until our credit ratings have been restored to investment grade. we are currently funding our customer financing activity through a combination of capital market offerings, third-party funding arrangements, including general electric ( ge ), merrill lynch, and de lage landen bank, cash generated from operations, cash on hand, other secured and unsecured borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we have outsourced approximately half of our overall world manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third party manufacturers and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience an interruption in supply or an increase in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers, and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by economic conditions abroad, including fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. approximately half of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components from, and maintain significant operations, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. our operating results may be negatively impacted by revenue trends. our ability to return to and maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced 12 through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, office and production services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in our developing markets operations and other geographic areas in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to return to and maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a substantial amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. as of december 31, 2005, we had $7.3 billion of total debt ($3.0 billion of which is secured by finance receivables) and $724 million of liabilities to trusts issuing preferred securities, which includes $98 million recorded as a component of other current liabilities. the total value of financing activities, shown on the balance sheet as finance receivables and on-lease equipment, was $8.3 billion at december 31, 2005. the total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was $1.6 billion at december 31, 2005. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements and to repay maturing debt and other obligations. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvements therein, funding from third parties, access to capital markets, securitizations and secured borrowings for our finance receivables portfolios. with $1.6 billion of total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of december 31, 2005, borrowing capacity under our 2003 credit facility of approximately $700 million and funding available through our customer financing arrangements, we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur and to satisfy all scheduled debt maturities for at least the next twelve months; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the 2003 credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: issuance of debt and preferred stock; investments and acquisitions; mergers; certain transactions with affiliates; creation of liens; asset transfers; hedging transactions; payment of dividends and certain other payments and intercompany 13 loans. the 2003 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including minimum ebitda, as defined, maximum leverage (total adjusted debt divided by ebitda), annual maximum capital expenditures limits and minimum consolidated net worth, as defined. the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain similar covenants. they do not, however, contain any financial maintenance covenants, except the fixed charge coverage ratio applicable to certain types of payments. our u.s. loan agreement with general electric capital corporation ( gecc ) (effective through 2010) relating to our customer financing program (the loan agreement ) provides for secured loans up to $5 billion outstanding at any time. as of december 31, 2005, $2.5 billion was outstanding under the loan agreement, including similar loan agreements with ge in the u.k. and canada. these agreements incorporate the financial maintenance covenants contained in the 2003 credit facility and contains other affirmative and negative covenants. at december 31, 2005, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the 2003 credit facility, the senior notes and the loan agreement and expect to remain in full compliance for at least the next twelve months. any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of the 2003 credit facility or the senior notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. failure to be in compliance with the covenants in the loan agreement, including the financial maintenance covenants incorporated from the 2003 credit facility, would result in an event of termination under the loan agreement and in such case gecc would not be required to make further loans to us. if gecc were to make no further loans to us, and assuming a similar facility was not established and that we were unable to obtain replacement financing in the public debt markets, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund our customers purchases of our equipment and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law and the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ), as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. we assess potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with legal counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. should developments in any of our legal matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. the european union directive known as the restriction on the use of hazardous substances ( rohs ), for example, requires the removal of lead, cadmium and certain other substances from product designs put on the market in the european union beginning in july 2006. we do not expect the rohs directive to have a material impact on our product lines. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prevented from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, we could also face substantial costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. beginning in 2005, we became subject to the european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment ( weee ) as enacted by individual european union countries ( weee legislation ), which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of recovered 14 products. we continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by weee legislation. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable country weee legislation, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management , in the xerox corporation 2005 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.risk factors we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, services, and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages which are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our continuing success in this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, or the price of color pages declines at a greater rate and faster pace than we anticipate, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if we fail to successfully develop new products and technologies, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would be reduced. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers needs through the development of new products or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. since 2000, we have engaged in a series of restructuring programs related to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, outsourcing some internal functions and engaging in other actions designed to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from the restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 12 our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales, the trend in our post-sale revenue growth, and, our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third party manufacturers and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers, and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by economic conditions abroad, including fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. approximately half of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components from, and maintain significant operations, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and revenue trends. our ability to return to and maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, office and production services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in our developing markets operations and other geographic areas in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 13 our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit market. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings. we are currently funding our customer financing activity through a combination of capital market offerings, cash generated from operations, cash on hand, other secured and unsecured borrowings and, to a lesser degree, third-party funding arrangements. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. as of december 31, 2006, we had $7.1 billion of total debt ($2.1 billion of which is secured by finance receivables) and $624 million of liabilities to trusts issuing preferred securities. the total value of financing activities, shown on the balance sheet as finance receivables and on-lease equipment, was $8.3 billion at december 31, 2006. the total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was $1.5 billion at december 31, 2006. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements and to repay maturing debt and other obligations. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvement therein, access to capital markets, securitizations, funding from third parties and borrowings secured by our finance receivables portfolios. as of december 31, 2006, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $1.5 billion, and our borrowing capacity under our 2006 credit facility was $1.235 billion, reflecting no outstanding borrowings and $15 million of letters of credit that have been utilized. we also have funding available through various secured borrowing arrangements. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets, secured borrowings, securitizations and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the 2006 credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: (i) liens of xerox and certain of our subsidiaries securing debt, (ii) certain fundamental changes to corporate structure, (iii) changes in nature of business and (iv) limitations on debt incurred by certain subsidiaries. the 2006 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: issuance of secured debt and preferred stock; investments and acquisitions; mergers; certain transactions with affiliates; creation of liens; asset transfers; hedging transactions; payment of dividends and certain other payments. they do not, however, contain any financial maintenance covenants, except the fixed charge coverage ratio applicable to certain types of payments. our u.s. loan agreement with general electric capital corporation ( gecc ) (effective through 2010) relating to our customer financing program (the loan 14 agreement ) provides for loans secured by eligible finance receivables up to $5 billion outstanding at any one time. as of december 31, 2006, $1.5 billion was outstanding under the loan agreement, including similar loan agreements with ge in the u.k. and canada. these agreements incorporate the financial maintenance covenants contained in the 2006 credit facility and contains other affirmative and negative covenants. at december 31, 2006, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the 2006 credit facility, the senior notes and the loan agreement. any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of the 2006 credit facility or the senior notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. failure to be in compliance with the covenants in the loan agreement, including the financial maintenance covenants incorporated from the 2006 credit facility, would result in an event of termination under the loan agreement and in such case gecc would not be required to make further loans to us. if gecc were to make no further loans to us, and assuming a similar facility was not established and that we were unable to obtain replacement financing in the public debt markets, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund our customers purchases of our equipment and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law and the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ), as discussed in the contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements. we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. we assess potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with legal counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. should developments in any of our legal matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, the european union directive known as the restriction on the use of hazardous substances ( rohs ), effective in july 2006, requires the removal of lead, cadmium and certain other substances from product designs put on the market in the european union beginning in july 2006. we continue rohs compliance activities with respect to our products. the rohs directive does not have a material impact on our product lines. in addition, various other countries and jurisdictions have proposed and/or are expected to adopt restrictions similar to rohs. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prevented from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, we could also face substantial costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. beginning in 2005, we became subject to the european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment ( weee ) as enacted by individual european union countries ( weee legislation ), which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of recovered products. we continue to conduct weee compliance activities and continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by weee legislation. other jurisdictions throughout the united states and the world have also proposed, or may adopt, product take-back regulations. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements, various efforts to limit energy use in products, and other environmentally related product programs. as these initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the

new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers needs through the development of new technologies and products or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that

further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 18 our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six

a $632 million liability to a subsidiary trust issuing preferred securities. the total value of financing activities, shown on the balance sheet as finance receivables and on-lease equipment, was $8.6

develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with legal counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. should developments in any of our legal matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or proposed or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items. the previously enacted european union directive known as the restriction on the use of hazardous substances ( rohs ) is one example. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prevented from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, or are expected to propose, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. the previously enacted european union directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment ( weee ) is one example. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements, various efforts to limit energy use in products, and other environmentally related product programs. for example, the european union energy-using products directive ( eup ) is expected to lead to the adoption of implementing measures intended to require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. it is possible that some or all of our products may be required to comply with eup implementing measures. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that will require parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition. 21 we need to successfully bring gis into our operations in order to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the transaction. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the gis acquisition is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to the risks that the future business operations of gis will not be successful; customer retention and revenue expansion goals for the gis transaction will not be met; and disruptions from the gis transaction will harm relationships with customers, employees, agents, distributors and suppliers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management , in the xerox corporation 2007 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.risk factors 18 risk factors current economic conditions and uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the global economy is currently undergoing a period of unprecedented volatility, which has affected the demand for equipment, services and supplies. a prolonged period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other risk factors we have described below. possible effects of current and/or future adverse economic conditions on our business include: decrease in purchases or usage of our products, services and supplies by customers as increased unemployment of office workers leads to lower utilization of our equipment and reduced advertising and media spend adversely impacts the graphic arts market; reduction in purchases of products and supplies by channel partners due to their efforts to reduce inventory and conserve cash and/or their inability to obtain financing; disruption in our business due to our inability to obtain equipment, parts and supplies from our suppliers and our suppliers from their suppliers if marginal supply businesses fail; increase in the cost of our products acquired from japan if the yen strengthens against the u.s. dollar and/or the euro, decreasing our profit margins or forcing us to increase prices of our products, thereby making our products less affordable to customers; higher level of collection delinquencies due to insolvency of our customers or shortage of cash to support their businesses; and decrease in our ability to hedge currency exposures due to higher hedging costs because of extreme volatility of exchange rates. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. if we fail to successfully develop new products and technologies and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would be reduced. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers needs through the development of new technologies and products or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further table of contents devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales, the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third party manufacturers and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by economic conditions abroad, including fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. approximately half of our revenue is generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components from, and maintain significant operations, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and revenue trends. our ability to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, office and production services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will table of contents be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages which are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our continuing success in this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, or the price of color pages declines at a greater rate and faster pace than we anticipate, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we are currently funding our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, other borrowings and, to a lesser degree, third-party funding arrangements. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. as of december 31, 2008, we had $8.4 billion of total debt and a $648 million liability to a subsidiary trust issuing preferred securities. the total value of finance assets, shown on the balance sheet as finance receivables and on-lease equipment, was $7.9 billion at december 31, 2008. the total cash and cash equivalents was $1.2 billion at december 31, 2008. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvement therein, access to capital markets, securitizations, funding from third parties and borrowings secured by our finance receivables portfolios. as of december 31, 2008, total cash and cash equivalents was $1.2 billion, and our borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $1.7 billion, reflecting $246 million of outstanding borrowings. we also have funding available through a secured borrowing arrangement with general electric capital corporation ( gecc ). we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets, secured borrowings, securitizations and funding from third table of contents parties, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: (i) liens of xerox and certain of our subsidiaries securing debt; (ii) certain fundamental changes to corporate structure; (iii) changes in nature of business and (iv) limitations on debt incurred by certain subsidiaries. the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: issuance of secured debt and preferred stock; investments and acquisitions; mergers; certain transactions with affiliates; creation of liens; asset transfers; hedging transactions; payment of dividends and certain other payments. they do not, however, contain any financial maintenance covenants, except the fixed charge coverage ratio applicable to certain types of payments. some of the covenants under our senior notes are suspended while we are rated investment grade. our u.s. loan agreement with gecc relating to our customer financing program (the loan agreement ) provides for loans secured by eligible finance receivables up to $5 billion outstanding at any one time. as of december 31, 2008, $56 million was outstanding under the loan agreement. the loan agreement incorporates the financial maintenance covenants contained in the credit facility and contains other affirmative and negative covenants. at december 31, 2008, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility, the senior notes and the loan agreement. failure to comply with material provisions of or covenants in the credit facility or the senior notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement would result in a termination event under the loan agreement and gecc would no longer be obligated to make further loans to us. if gecc were to make no further loans to us, and assuming that (a) our cash flow was inadequate and (b) we were unable to procure a similar facility or otherwise obtain replacement financing in the public debt markets, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund our customers purchases of our equipment and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law and the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ), as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products, and other environmentally related product programs. for example, the european union energy-using products directive ( eup ) is expected to lead to the adoption of implementing measures intended to require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. it is possible that some or all of our products may be required to comply with eup implementing measures. another example is the table of contents european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that will require parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 25 quantitative and

acquisition of acs in february 2010. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. 21 table of contents we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvement therein, access to capital markets, securitizations, funding from third parties and borrowings secured by our finance receivables portfolios. as of december 31, 2009, total cash and cash equivalents was $3.8 billion, and our borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $2.0 billion, reflecting no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2009 included net proceeds from the $2.0 billion senior notes issued in december 2009 which were used to fund the acquisition of acs in february 2010. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets, secured borrowings, securitizations and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: (i) liens of xerox and certain of our subsidiaries securing debt; (ii) certain fundamental changes to corporate structure; (iii) changes in nature of business and (iv) limitations on debt incurred by certain subsidiaries. the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on: issuance of secured debt and preferred stock; investments and acquisitions; mergers; certain transactions with affiliates; creation of liens; asset transfers; hedging transactions; payment of dividends and certain other payments. they do not, however, contain any financial maintenance covenants, except the fixed charge coverage ratio applicable to certain types of payments. some of the covenants under our senior notes are suspended while we are rated investment grade. at december 31, 2009, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility and the senior notes. failure to comply with material provisions of or covenants in the credit facility or the senior notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. we need to successfully execute the transition of affiliated computer services, inc. in order to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the transaction. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the affiliated computer services, inc. ( acs ) acquisition is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, the risks that: the future business operations of acs will not be successful; customer retention, cost synergies and revenue expansion goals for the acs transaction will not be met; and disruptions from the acs transaction will harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law and the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ), as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations 22 table of contents and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products, and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union energy-using products directive ( eup ) is expected to lead to the adoption of implementing measures intended to require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. it is possible that some or all of our products may be required to comply with eup implementing measures. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that will require parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition. our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to perform our services under the contract, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or the reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as, among other things, a customer or client merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer or client exercise of contract termination rights. we rely to a significant extent on third party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers, and could be materially adversely affected if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third party providers do not meet these obligations or our expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. governments and their agencies may have the right to terminate many of these contracts at any time without cause. these contracts, upon their expiration or termination, are typically subject to a bidding process in which xerox may not be successful. also, our contracts with governmental entities are generally subject to the approval of annual appropriations by the united states congress or other legislative/governing bodies to fund the expenditures of the governmental entities under those contracts. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 23 table of contents we are subject to united states and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including social security numbers, financial and health information. for example, in 1996, congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein, the department of health and human services established regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates. another example is the european union directive on data protection, entitled directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. we have also taken steps to address the requirements of that directive. other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well and additional legislation may be enacted at any time. failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to, among other things, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breach of our security systems. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our, our customers and clients and our suppliers confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management, in the xerox corporation 2009 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.risk factors 22 risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenues are generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components from, and maintain significant operations, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to u.s. dollar and japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services and/or business process services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications; periodically enhance our existing offerings and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales, the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2010 form 10-k 22 table of contents our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. our ability to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third-party manufacturers and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for our services contracts, we rely to a significant extent on third-party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers; if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third-party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third-party providers do not meet these obligations or our expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages that are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our continuing success in this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, or the price of color pages declines at a greater rate and faster pace than we anticipate, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. xerox 2010 form 10-k 23 table of contents our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to perform our services under the contract, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or the reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as, among other things, a customer or client merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer or client exercise of contract termination rights. if we fail to successfully develop new products and technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would be reduced. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers needs through the development of new products and technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we are currently funding our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings and other borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. as of december 31, 2010, we had $8.6 billion of total debt and a $650 million liability to a subsidiary trust issuing preferred securities. the total value of finance assets, shown on the balance sheet as finance receivables and on-lease equipment, was $7.2 billion at december 31, 2010. the total cash and cash equivalents was $1.2 billion at december 31, 2010. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. xerox 2010 form 10-k 24 table of contents we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing

a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. xerox 2010 form 10-k 26 table of contents we are subject to united states and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including social security numbers, financial and health information. for example, in 1996, congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein, the department of health and human services established regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates. another example is the european union directive on data protection, entitled directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. we have also taken steps to address the requirements of that directive. other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well and additional legislation may be enacted at any time. failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to, among other things, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breach of our security systems. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our, our customers and clients and our suppliers confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management, in the xerox corporation 2010 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference. xerox 2010 form 10-k 29 table of contentsrisk factors x risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economics, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenues are generated from operations outside the united states. in addition, we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components from, and maintain significant operations, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen to u.s. dollar and japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters. we generally hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions primarily through the use of currency derivative contracts. the use of derivative contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than our u.s. parent functional currency, within our consolidated financial statements. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. some of the large international companies have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services and/or business process services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications; periodically enhance our existing offerings and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. we from time to time engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as lean six sigma, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales, the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. our ability to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction systems. we expect that revenue growth can be further enhanced through our document management and consulting services in the areas of personalized and product life cycle communications, enterprise managed print services and document content and imaging. the ability to achieve growth in our equipment placements is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to provide advanced systems, industry-oriented global solutions and services for major customers, improve direct and indirect sales productivity and expand our indirect distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing pressures. our ability to increase post sale revenue is largely dependent on our ability to increase the volume of pages printed, the mix of color pages, equipment utilization and color adoption, as well as our ability to retain a high level of supplies sales in unbundled contracts. equipment placements typically occur through leases with original terms of three to five years. there will be a lag between the increase in equipment placement and an increase in post sale revenues. the ability to grow our customers' usage of our products may continue to be adversely impacted by the movement toward distributed printing and electronic substitutes and the impact of lower equipment placements in prior periods. if we are unable to maintain a consistent trend of revenue growth, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. for our services contracts, we rely to a significant extent on third-party providers, such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors, utility providers and network providers; if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our ability to service our customers and clients and deliver and implement solutions depends to a large extent on third-party providers such as subcontractors, a relatively small number of primary software vendors and utility providers and network providers meeting their obligations to us and our expectations in a timely, quality manner. our business, revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if these third-party providers do not meet these obligations or our expectations or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or were to offer their products to us with less advantageous prices and other terms than we previously had. in addition, a number of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services, including electricity and water, may not be consistently reliable and, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability. we are subject to united states and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a service provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information, including social security numbers, financial and health information. for example, in 1996, congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein, the department of health and human services established regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information. we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates. another example is the european union directive on data protection, entitled directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. we have also taken steps to address the requirements of that directive. other united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well and additional legislation may be enacted at any time. failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to, among other things, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breach of our security systems. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our, our customers' and clients' and our suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. these include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk. in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, we sometimes make significant capital investments to perform our services under the contract, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. the net book value of such assets recorded, including a portion of our intangible assets, could be impaired, and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or the reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as, among other things, a customer's or client's merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a customer's or client's exercise of contract termination rights. if we fail to successfully develop new products and technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would be reduced. the process of developing new high technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. however, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. it is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. we also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and newly enacted applicable regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold, particularly european union environmental directives. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products and technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit ratings and is subject to credit market volatility. we are currently funding our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings and other borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, primarily to support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and improvement therein, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets and funding from third parties, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. the credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2011, we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions of or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. governments and their agencies may have the right to terminate many of these contracts at any time without cause. these contracts, upon their expiration or termination, are typically subject to a bidding process in which xerox may not be successful. also, our contracts with governmental entities are generally subject to the approval of annual appropriations by the united states congress or other legislative/governing bodies to fund the expenditures of the governmental entities under those contracts. additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits, investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations and face the risks associated with relying on third-party manufacturers and external suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing operations to third parties and various service providers. to the extent that we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, they may not be able to quickly respond to changes in customer demand for our products, they may not be able to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and the reliability of our products could decline. if any of these risks were to be realized, and assuming similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we need to develop and expand the use of color printing and copying. increasing the proportion of pages that are printed in color and transitioning color pages currently produced on offset devices to xerox technology represent key growth opportunities. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces color prints and copies quickly, easily, with high quality and at reduced cost. our continuing success in this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market, as well as the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers. if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive color technologies or the pace of color adoption by our existing and prospective customers is less than anticipated, or the price of color pages declines at a greater rate and faster pace than we anticipate, we may be unable to capture these opportunities and it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning securities law, intellectual property law, environmental law, employment law and the employee retirement income security act ( erisa ), as discussed in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products, and other environmentally related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-using products directive ( eup ) is expected to lead to the adoption of implementing measures intended to require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. it is possible that some or all of our products may be required to comply with eup implementing measures. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that will require parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk x quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption financial risk management, in the xerox corporation 2011 annual report is hereby incorporated by reference.risk factors 9 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information included, and risks described, in other sections of this form 10-k, including under the headings cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements , legal proceedings , selected financial data , and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. the selected risks described below, however, are not the only risks facing us. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited. we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the declines in installations and printed pages, fewer devices per location and an increase in electronic documentation. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models. these market and competitive trends make it difficult to reverse the current declines in revenue over the past several years. a third set of challenges relates to our continued efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity in light of declining revenues. in addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete, as well as, the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate. if we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business. we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel while our business model undergoes significant changes. xerox is undergoing significant changes in our business model and, accordingly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future. our success is dependent, among other things, on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified senior management and other key employees. competition for key personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. the departure of existing key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept employment with xerox, despite our recruiting efforts, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economic and political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes. a significant portion of our revenue is generated from operations, and we manufacture or acquire many of our products and/or their components, outside the united states. our future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the japanese yen, the euro and the british pound - as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in local economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax regulations and other related legal matters. we use currency derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and anticipated transactions. this practice is intended to mitigate or reduce volatility in the results of our foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate it. we do not hedge the translation effect of international revenues and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. if our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic or political conditions abroad and we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. tariffs or other restrictions on foreign imports could negatively impact our financial performance. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by a potential increase in the cost of our products as a result of new or incremental trade protection measures such as, increased import tariffs, import or export restrictions and requirements and the revocation or material modification of trade agreements. changes in u.s. and international trade policy and resultant retaliatory countermeasures, including imposition of increased tariffs, quotas or duties by affected countries, and trading partners are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business. the u.s. government has and could in the future impose trade barriers including tariffs, quotas, duties or other restrictions on foreign imports. the implementation of a border tax, tariff or higher customs duties on our products xerox 2019 annual report 9 table of contents manufactured abroad or components that we import into the u.s., or any potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business, could negatively impact our financial performance. we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. we operate in approximately 160 countries and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our income taxes. local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. we regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. if we fail to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to retain current customers and gain new customers and our revenues would decline. the process of developing new products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. it requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. we must work with our supply partners and commit resources before knowing whether these initiatives will result in products that are commercially successful and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. in developing these new technologies and products, we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. it is possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. also, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, some of our products rely on technologies developed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, our strategy requires us to expand into adjacent markets with new products, services and technology such as digital packaging and print, ai workflow assistants for knowledge workers, 3d printing / digital manufacturing, it services and software. our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and technologies for these adjacent markets requires the investment of significant resources, which may not lead to the development of new technologies, products or services on a timely basis. we must also attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products, particularly as we increase investment in these areas of the business. similar to above if we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers' needs in these adjacent markets through the development of new products, technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our government contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts. a significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control xerox 2019 annual report 10 table of contents act of 2011) or other debt or funding constraints, could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. additionally, government agencies routinely audit government contracts. if the government finds that we inappropriately charged costs to a contract, the costs will be non-reimbursable or, to the extent reimbursed, refunded to the government. if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. further, the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits or, investigations could have an adverse effect on our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. we face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, and demands of customers to become more efficient. our competitors include large international companies some of which have significant financial resources and compete with us globally to provide document processing products and services in each of the markets we serve. we compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. our future success is largely dependent upon our ability to compete in the markets we currently serve, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. to remain competitive, we must develop services, applications and new products; periodically enhance our existing offerings; remain cost efficient; and attract and retain key personnel and management. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and such loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to improve our cost structure. our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services that will provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from current levels. in addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. if we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we continually review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. if we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior cost reduction actions, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as project own it, the level of pricing pressures on our products and services, the proportion of high-end as opposed to low-end equipment sales (product mix), the trend in our post-sale revenue growth and our ability to successfully complete information technology initiatives. if any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through design efficiency, supplier and manufacturing cost improvements and information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation, potential materials cost increases and competitive price pressures would be impaired, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business. we engage in restructuring actions, including project own it, as well as other transformation efforts in order to reduce our cost structure, realign it to the changing nature of our business and achieve operating efficiencies. in addition, these actions are expected to simplify our organizational structure, upgrade our it infrastructure and redesign business processes. we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with xerox 2019 annual report 11 table of contents our restructuring actions. additionally, as a result of our restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. transformation and restructuring may require a significant amount of time and focus from both management and other employees, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. furthermore, the expected savings associated with these initiatives may be offset to some extent by business disruption during the implementation phase as well as investments in new processes and systems until the initiatives are fully implemented and stabilized. if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. as part of our efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs, we have offshored and outsourced certain of our operations, services and other functions through captive arrangements as well as with third-parties (e.g. hcl) and we will continue to evaluate additional offshoring or outsourcing possibilities in the future. if our outsourcing partners or operations fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels or if we are unable to attract or retain sufficient personnel with the necessary skill sets to meet our offshoring or outsourcing needs, the quality of our services, products and operations, as well as our reputation, could suffer. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage these potential transitions and issues, which in certain circumstances could be largely outside of our control. in addition, much of our offshoring takes place in developing countries and as a result may also be subject to geopolitical uncertainty. diminished service quality from offshoring and outsourcing could have an adverse material impact to our operating results due to service interruptions and negative customer reactions. we are subject to laws of the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information, and failure to comply with those laws could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations. we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, both in our role as a technology provider and as an employer. as a result, we are subject to numerous united states (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information. these laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. for example, the general data protection regulation that came into force in the european union in may 2018. changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area, or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. we are subject to breaches of our security systems, cyber-attacks and service interruptions, which could expose us to liability, litigation, and regulatory action and damage our reputation. we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining and protecting our own, and our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information, including information related to identifiable individuals, against unauthorized access or disclosure. despite such efforts, we may be subject to breaches of our security systems resulting in unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems and the information we are trying to protect. moreover, the risk of such attacks includes attempted breaches not only of our systems, but also those of our customers, clients and suppliers. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing, are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until after an exploitation of information has occurred. therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems, or those of our suppliers, or accidental loss or disclosure of proprietary or confidential information about us, our clients or our customers could result in, among other things, a total shutdown of our systems that would disrupt our ability to conduct business or pay vendors and employees. in the event of such actions, we could be exposed to unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. while from time to time attempts are made to access our systems, these attempts have not resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our systems. we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect this information and our infrastructure. xerox 2019 annual report 12 table of contents we have outsourced a significant portion of our manufacturing operations and increasingly rely on third-party manufacturers, subcontractors and suppliers. we have outsourced a significant portion of our manufacturing operations to third parties, such as fuji xerox co., ltd. we face the risk that those manufacturers may not be able to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, quickly respond to changes in customer demand, and obtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process. in addition, they may experience labor shortages and/or disruptions, manufacturing costs could be higher than planned and lead to higher prices for our products and the reliability of our products could decline. further, since certain third parties we have outsourced manufacturing to also are our competitors in the print market, or may be in the future, we could experience product disruption as a result of competitive pressures that increase the cost of the products supplied. if any of these risks were to be realized, and similar third-party manufacturing relationships could not be established, we could experience interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in our being unable to meet customer demand for our products, damage our relationships with our customers and reduce our market share, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, in our services business we may partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. therefore, our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our customers' requirements and schedules. if we or our partners fail to deliver services or products as required and on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. we need to successfully manage changes in the printing environment and market because our operating results may be negatively impacted by lower equipment placements and usage trends. the printing market and environment is changing as a result of new technologies, shifts in customer preferences in printing and the expansion of new printing markets as well as ancillary markets. the process of developing new high-technology products, software, services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. examples include mobile printing, color printing, packaging, print on objects, continuous feed inkjet printing and the expansion of the market for entry products (a4 printers) and high-end products as well as electronic delivery, and cloud-based computing and software. these changing market trends are also opening up new ancillary markets for our products, services and software. a significant part of our strategy and ultimate success in this changing market is our ability to develop and market technology that produces products, services and software that meet these changes. we expect that revenue growth can be improved through improvements in the software features of our multifunction devices, increases in the color printer through expansion to metallic, fluorescent, and clear ink and digital packaging, and leveraging a strong base in managed print services with new digital, analytics, security features. our software strategy involves software for integrated solutions and delivery of industry-focused services into an existing customer base. we also expect to extend our presence in the smb market through organic and inorganic investments as well as further expansion into channels and ecommerce and invest in innovation including digital packaging, ai workflow assistants for knowledge workers, 3d printing and digital manufacturing, sensors and services for iot and cleantech. our future success in executing on this strategy depends on our ability to make the investments and commit the necessary resources in this highly competitive market. despite this investment, the process of developing new products or technologies is inherently complex and uncertain and there are a number of risks that we are subject to including the risk that our products or technologies will successfully satisfy our customers' needs or gain market acceptance . if we are unable to develop and market advanced and competitive technologies, it may negatively impact our future revenue growth and market share as well as our planned expansion into new or alternative markets. additionally, it may negatively impact expansion of our worldwide equipment placements, as well as sales of services and supplies occurring after the initial equipment placement (post sale revenue) in the key growth markets of digital printing, color and multifunction system. if we are unable to maintain a consistent level of revenue, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our ability to fund our customer financing activities at economically competitive levels depends on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. the long-term viability and profitability of our customer financing activities is dependent, in part, on our ability to borrow and the cost of borrowing in the credit markets. this ability and cost, in turn, is dependent on our credit rating, which is currently non-investment grade, and is subject to credit market volatility. we primarily fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand, capital market offerings, sales and xerox 2019 annual report 13 table of contents securitizations of finance receivables and commercial paper borrowings. our ability to continue to offer customer financing and be successful in the placement of equipment with customers is largely dependent on our ability to obtain funding at a reasonable cost. if we are unable to continue to offer customer financing, or find an economic alternative, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and pose challenges for conducting our business. our ability to provide customer financing is a significant competitive advantage. we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and other obligations, the majority of which support our customer financing activities. our substantial debt and other obligations could have important consequences. for example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (iii) increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because a portion of our debt has variable interest rates; (iv) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service debt and other obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations for other purposes; (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; (vi) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and (vii) become due and payable upon a change in control. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee benefit - related funding requirements . we sponsor several defined benefit pension and retiree-health benefit plans throughout the world. we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans. although most of our major defined benefit plans have been amended to freeze current benefits and eliminate benefit accruals for future service, the projected benefit obligations under these benefit plans is measured annually and at december 31, 2019 exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately $1.2 billion. the current underfunded status of these plans is a significant factor in determining the ongoing future contributions we will be required to make to these plans. accordingly, we expect to have additional funding requirements in future years, and we may make additional, voluntary contributions to the plans. depending on our cash position at the time, any such funding or contributions to our defined benefit plans could impact our operating flexibility and financial position, including adversely affecting our cash flow for the quarter in which such funding or contributions are made. weak economic conditions and related under-performance of asset markets could also lead to increases in our funding requirements . we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to meet our operating cash flow requirements, repay maturing debt and meet other financial obligations, such as payment of dividends to the extent declared by our board of directors. if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements, it may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations and continuing operating improvements, access to capital markets and funding from third parties. we believe our liquidity (including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate) will be sufficient to meet operating requirements as they occur; however, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward subject to the general liquidity of and on-going changes in the credit markets as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control. our $1.8 billion credit facility (the credit facility) contains financial maintenance covenants, including maximum leverage (debt for borrowed money divided by consolidated ebitda, as defined) and a minimum interest coverage ratio (consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined). at december 31, 2019 , we were in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility. failure to comply with material provisions or covenants in the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory matters. we have various contingent liabilities that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: securities law; governmental entity contracting, servicing and procurement laws; intellectual property law; environmental law; employment law; the employee retirement income security act (erisa); and other laws and regulations, as discussed xerox 2019 annual report 14 table of contents in the contingencies note in the consolidated financial statements. should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or materially increase an existing accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts above any existing accruals, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs. due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries. our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the u.s. the activities of these entities may not comply with u.s. laws or business practices or our code of business conduct. violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. xerox is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by u.s. or state environmental agencies under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), known as "superfund," or state laws. some of our manufacturing operations use, and some of our products contain, substances that are regulated in various jurisdictions. for example, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted, or are expected to adopt, restrictions on the types and amounts of chemicals that may be present in electronic equipment or other items that we use or sell. recently, a number of studies have been published by third parties regarding chemicals utilized in our industry, as well as potential health/safety impacts of machine emissions. additional studies are planned, and depending on the results of such studies, regulatory initiatives could follow. we are monitoring these developments. if we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use of such substances and the sale of products containing such substances, then we could be subject to liability and could be prohibited from selling our products in their existing forms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. further, various countries and jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to adopt, programs that make producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for certain labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of these recovered products. if we are unable to collect, recycle, treat and dispose of our products in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable requirements, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. other potentially relevant initiatives throughout the world include proposals for more extensive chemical registration requirements and/or possible bans on the use of certain chemicals, various efforts to limit energy use in products and other environmentally-related programs impacting products and operations, such as those associated with climate change accords, agreements and regulations. for example, the european union's energy-related products directive (erp) has led to the adoption of implementing measures or "voluntary agreements" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards, in connection with energy use and potentially other environmental parameters and impacts. a number of our products are already required to comply with erp requirements and further regulations are being developed by the e.u. authorities. another example is the european union reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals), a broad initiative that requires parties throughout the supply chain to register, assess and disclose information regarding many chemicals in their products. depending on the types, applications, forms and uses of chemical substances in various products, reach and similar regulatory programs in other jurisdictions could lead to restrictions and/or bans on certain chemical usage. in the united states, the toxics substances control act (tsca) is undergoing a major overhaul with similar potential for regulatory challenges. xerox continues its efforts toward monitoring and evaluating the applicability of these and numerous other regulatory initiatives in an effort to develop compliance strategies. as these and similar initiatives and programs become regulatory requirements throughout the world and/or are adopted as public or private procurement requirements, we must comply or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. similarly, environmentally driven procurement requirements voluntarily adopted by customers in the marketplace (e.g., u.s. epa energystar, epeat) are constantly evolving and becoming more stringent, presenting further market access challenges if our products fail to comply. concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. for example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries, states and territories in which we operate. enacted laws and/or regulatory actions to address concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could negatively impact our business, including the availability of our products or the cost to obtain or sell those products. xerox 2019 annual report 15 table of contents the united kingdom leaving the e.u. could adversely affect us. in 2016, the u.k. approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as brexit and the u.k. withdrew from the e.u. on january 31, 2020. the future relationship between the u.k. and the e.u. remains uncertain as the u.k. and the e.u. work through the transition period that provides time for them to negotiate the details of their future relationship. the transition period is currently expected to end on december 31, 2020, and, if no agreement is reached, the default scenario would be a no-deal brexit. in the event of a no-deal brexit, the u.k. will leave the e.u. with no agreements in place beyond any temporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the e.u. or individual e.u. member states, and the u.k. as part of no-deal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the world trade organization. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the u.k. leaving the e.u. with no agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. we have operations and customers in the united kingdom and the e.u. , and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may follow brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the united kingdom as well as potential for disruptions in our supply chain in the united kingdom. brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. for example, depending on the terms of brexit, the united kingdom could also lose access to the single e.u. market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u. on behalf of its members. disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our products and services. any of these effects of brexit, and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. refer to note 17 - financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. foreign exchange risk management assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2019 , it would not significantly change the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities as all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of december 31, 2019 . a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2019 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $311 million. the net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily xerox limited and xerox canada inc. and translated into u.s. dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $3.1 billion at december 31, 2019 . interest rate risk management the consolidated average interest rate associated with our total debt for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 approximated 4.9%, 4.6%, and 4.6%, respectively. interest expense includes the impact of our interest rate derivatives. virtually all customer-financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. the interest rates on a significant portion of the company's term debt are fixed. as of december 31, 2019 , $200 million of our total debt of $4.3 billion carried variable interest rates, including the effect of pay variable interest rate swaps, if any, which we may use to reduce the effective interest rate on our fixed coupon debt. the fair market values of our fixed-rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. at december 31, 2019 , a 10% change in market interest rates would change the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $58 million.
