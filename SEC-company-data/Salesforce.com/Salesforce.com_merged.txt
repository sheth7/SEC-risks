risk factors 9 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our services and new errors in our services may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services. interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. 9 table of contents as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers' data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the united states. companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. even with disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted. as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our services involve the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. while we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our it data, our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards for such technology consistent with our other services; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; 10 table of contents delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. any of these risks could harm our business. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. also, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment, which could negatively impact our financial results. privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. in some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's data protection directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the european union's e-privacy directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. further, there are various statutes and regulations relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa). the interpretation of many of these statutes and regulations is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply with them may have an adverse impact on our business. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business. 11 table of contents in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we rely on third-party computer hardware, software and cloud computing platforms that could cause errors in, or failures of, our services and may be difficult to replace. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. any errors or defects in third-party hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our services, which could harm our business. these hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: on premise offerings from enterprise software application vendors; cloud computing application service providers; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; social media companies; traditional platform development environment companies; cloud computing development platform companies; and internally developed applications (by our potential customers' it departments). many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. 12 table of contents our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter has become our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements; the attrition rates for our services; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size, invoice timing and new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the number of new employees; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our services; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our services to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our services; technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; income tax effects; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisition or investments; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; 13 table of contents the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the markets for our analytics cloud and community cloud remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. historically, sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data protection and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; 14 table of contents different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. we cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer. if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. 15 table of contents supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. 16 table of contents in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. for example, during fiscal 2015, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents. while we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. in addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 17 table of contents we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes. we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals currently being considered by many countries including the united states as well as several european countries. additionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. we have a high level of debt, including our 0.25% senior notes due april 1, 2018, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capital lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. in addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. our maintenance of this indebtedness could: 18 table of contents impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; 19 table of contents announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and issuance of debt or other convertible securities. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. in addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. in addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. in addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. 20 table of contents the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. if, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. in addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. 21 table of contents in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. in accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion at january 31, 2015 . this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2015 could result in a $13.5 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. as of january 31, 2015 , we had restricted cash totaling $115.0 million that was held in a money market account, which is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. at january 31, 2014 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion . the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $8.8 million. market risk and market interest risk in march 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% senior notes ) (collectively the notes ). holders of the 0.25% senior notes may convert the 0.25% senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the notes. for the 0.25% senior notes, the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. the 0.25% senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes. however, the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our 0.25% notes is affected by our stock price. the principal balance of our 0.25% senior notes was $1.15 billion as of january 31, 2015 . the total estimated fair value of our 0.25% senior notes at january 31, 2015 was $1.3 billion . the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , which was $110.87. in october 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the credit agreement ) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in october 2019 (the credit facility ). immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the credit facility. 56 table of contents borrowings under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate formula, as defined in the credit agreement, or a libor based formula, each as set forth in the credit agreement. additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. by entering into the credit agreement, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate, as defined in the credit agreement, or libor. the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was 1.7% for the period beginning october 6, 2014 and ended january 31, 2015 . changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, therefore our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. the bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. we monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. we generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. however, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. our portfolio consists of investments in approximately 100 companies, with our investments in these companies ranging from $0.2 million to $40.0 million. as of january 31, 2015 and january 31, 2014 the carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies was $158.0 million and $77.0 million , respectively. the estimated fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $280.0 million as of january 31, 2015 . 57 table of contentsrisk factors 11 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our services involve the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. while we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our it data, our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services. we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers' data are currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. even with disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our services could be interrupted. 11 table of contents when we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. in some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's data protection directive, and the country-specific laws and regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the european union's e-privacy directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. for example, in october 2015, the european court of justice invalidated the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain european legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the united states. while other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework may result in different european data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for salesforce and its customers. the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. further, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa) and related federal communication commission (fcc) orders. the interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. 12 table of contents we rely on third-party computer hardware, software and cloud computing platforms that could cause errors in, or failures of, our services and may be difficult to replace. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. any errors or defects in third-party hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our services, which could harm our business. these hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including crm, collaboration and business intelligence software. we also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: on premise offerings from enterprise software application vendors; cloud computing application service providers; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; social media companies; traditional platform development environment companies; cloud computing development platform companies; internally developed applications (by our potential customers' it departments); and internet of things platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies. many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results. we invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment, which could be material. we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. 13 table of contents as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards for such technology consistent with our other services; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. any of these risks could harm our business. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements; the attrition rates for our services; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 14 table of contents the number of new employees; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our services; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our services to large enterprises; evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our services; technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; income tax effects; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisition or investments; other than temporary impairments in the value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; regulatory compliance costs; changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. 15 table of contents if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the markets for our analytics, communities and internet of things clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the crm market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. historically, sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders; 16 table of contents treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. we cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer. if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. we conduct our business in the following locations: united states, europe, canada, asia pacific and japan. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the 17 table of contents result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. 18 table of contents we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. for example, during fiscal 2015, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents. while we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. in addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. 19 table of contents our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. in addition, positions the company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. in addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, or aloha spirit, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. as our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our future success. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes. we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. 20 table of contents our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in u.s federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation recently enacted in the united kingdom and australia, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions. additionally, the organisation for economic co-operation and development recently released final guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities. we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. we have a high level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in march 2013 (the 0.25% senior notes ) due april 1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased 50 fremont, and capital lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. in addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. finally, we have a revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $650.0 million. as of january 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. our maintenance of this indebtedness and any additional issuance of indebtedness could: impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. the new lease accounting guidance places operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal 2020, which results in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. 21 table of contents weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and issuance of debt or other convertible securities. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced 22 table of contents volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. in addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. in addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. in addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. if, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. in addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may 23 table of contents choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 60 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. in accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion at january 31, 2016 . this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2016 could result in a $20.9 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2015 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion . the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.5 million . market risk and market interest risk in march 2013, we issued the 0.25% senior notes. holders of the 0.25% senior notes may convert the 0.25% senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% senior notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% senior notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% senior notes. the 0.25% senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% senior notes. however, the value of the 0.25% senior notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% senior notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our 0.25% senior notes is affected by our stock price. the principal balance of our 0.25% senior notes was $1.15 billion as of january 31, 2016 . the total estimated fair value of our 0.25% senior notes at january 31, 2016 was $1.4 billion . the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , which was $119.24. in october 2014, we entered into the credit agreement, which provides for the $650.0 million credit facility that matures in october 2019. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate formula, as defined in the credit agreement, or a libor based formula, each as set forth in the credit agreement. additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. as of january 31, 2016 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit agreement. 60 table of contents by entering into the credit agreement, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate, as defined in the credit agreement, or libor. changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, therefore our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. the bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. we monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. we generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. however, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 150 privately held companies, primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. we invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and crm offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the americas, europe and asia pacific. our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million , with 14 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. as of january 31, 2016 and january 31, 2015 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $504.5 million and $158.0 million , respectively. the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $714.1 million and $280.0 million as of january 31, 2016 and january 31, 2015 , respectively. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. all of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 61 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. while we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our it systems, our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. 10 table of contents interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers' data are currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. these hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. when we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. the internet's infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. this infrastructure is run by a series of independent third party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names (icann) and the internet assigned numbers authority (iana), now under the stewardship of icann. the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet, resulting in multiple separate internets. these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. in some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's data protection directive, and the country-specific laws and regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the european union's e-privacy directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our 11 table of contents customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. for example, in october 2015, the european court of justice invalidated the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain european legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the united states. while other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework may result in different european data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers. the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. further, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa) and related federal communication commission (fcc) orders. the interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including crm, collaboration, e-commerce and business intelligence software. we also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors; cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; traditional platform development environment companies; 12 table of contents cloud computing development platform companies; internally developed applications (by our potential customers' it departments); iot platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; e-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; and artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; additional stock based compensation; the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages and cultures; currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. any of these risks could harm our business. in addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. for example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be 13 table of contents diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results. we invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment, which could be material. we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements; the attrition rates for our services; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements; the seasonality of our customers' businesses, especially commerce cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the british pound; variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings; the number of new employees; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our services; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our services to large enterprises; evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; 14 table of contents conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; income tax effects; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; other than temporary impairments in the value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; regulatory compliance costs; changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements, for example, the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ( asu 2014-09 ), the new revenue recognition standard; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the markets for our analytics, community, iot, commerce and salesforce quip clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in 15 table of contents significant revenue for us. commerce cloud originated as part of our demandware acquisition and salesforce quip originated from our acquisition of quip. further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the crm market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations. we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. historically, sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented less than 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states, as well as international operations generally, include: localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; tax policies addressing multinational operations; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. 16 table of contents additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer. if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. we conduct our business in the following locations: united states, europe, canada, asia, south america and australia. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling, the euro and japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. recent events, including the united kingdom's 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union, or brexit, and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the european union and elsewhere could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations and related risks for our business. 17 table of contents supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. 18 table of contents in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. in addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. in addition, positions the company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management 19 table of contents team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. in addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, or aloha spirit, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. as our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our future success. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions. we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation enacted in the united kingdom and australia, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions. additionally, in october 2015, the organisation for economic co-operation and development released final guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities. we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. 20 table of contents our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. we have a high level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in march 2013 (the 0.25% senior notes ) due april 1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco, california ( 50 fremont ) and capital lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. in addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. in july 2016, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. also in july 2016, we entered into the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of demandware. maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. new lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. in addition, recent geopolitical developments, including brexit, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets; the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. 21 table of contents natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition, the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting, to alter our operational policies so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published financial statements. such changes may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. in addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the commerce department's export administration regulations, u.s. customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control. if we fail to comply with these u.s. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, the u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to u.s. sanctions targets, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; 22 table of contents changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and issuance of debt or other convertible securities. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. in addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. we may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. in addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. in addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on the notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. the fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. 23 table of contents the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. if, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. in addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. 24 table of contents in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the united states, europe, canada, asia, south america and australia. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar ( usd ). these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. our european revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the british pound. this results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound are first converted into the british pound and then british pounds are translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements. as an example, revenues in france are translated from the euro to the british pound and then into the usd. our statement of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies, deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. foreign currency transaction risk our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer trade accounts, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. 52 table of contents we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 ( asc 815 ), derivatives and hedging. accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expense and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into u.s. dollars. as the u.s. dollar strengthened against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in u.s. dollars for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were lower relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion at january 31, 2017 . this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2017 could result in a $13.0 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion . the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $20.9 million . market risk and market interest risk we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. in march 2013, we issued the 0.25% senior notes due april 1, 2018. holders of the 0.25% senior notes may convert the 0.25% senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% senior notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% senior notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% senior notes. the 0.25% senior notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% senior notes. however, the value of the 0.25% senior notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% senior notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our 0.25% senior notes is affected by our stock price. the principal balance of our 0.25% senior notes was $1.15 billion as of january 31, 2017 . the total estimated fair value of our 0.25% senior notes at january 31, 2017 53 table of contents was $1.5 billion . the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , which was $126.52. in july 2016, we amended our credit agreement (the revolving loan credit agreement ) to provide for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility ) that matures in july 2021. the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25%, with such rate being based on the our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. as of january 31, 2017 , there was a $200.0 million outstanding borrowing amount under the credit agreement. the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the credit facility was 1.9% for fiscal 2017 . subsequent to january 31, 2017 , we paid the remaining balance of the credit facility. in february 2015, we assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 fremont (the loan ). the loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in june 2023. the loan requires interest only payments with the remaining principal due at maturity. the loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. the agreement governing the loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of january 31, 2017 . in july 2016, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (the term loan ) which matures in july 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. we entered into the term loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of demandware. interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate. the term loan is payable in july 2019, with the outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity. by entering into the term loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor. the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 1.8 % as of january 31, 2017 . changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. we monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. we generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. however, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 180 privately held companies, primarily comprised of isvs and system integrators. we invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and crm offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the americas, europe and asia pacific. our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million , with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. as of january 31, 2017 and january 31, 2016 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $526.0 million and $504.5 million , respectively. the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $758.3 million and $714.1 million as of january 31, 2017 and january 31, 2016 , respectively. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. all of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 54 table of contentsrisk factors 9 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. while we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states. our security measures could also be compromised by employee error or malfeasance, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to, or denying authorized access to our it systems, our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems. 9 table of contents because the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage it systems change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques. our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem and, as illustrated by the recent spectre and meltdown threats, if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, a security breach could occur. in addition, our internal it systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our it systems. these risks are mitigated by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our servers. because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software may result in additional direct and indirect costs, for example additional infrastructure capacity to mitigate any system degradation that could result from remediation efforts. defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. we use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. for many of our offerings, our production environment and customers' data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. 10 table of contents these hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. when we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. privacy concerns and laws such as the european union's general data protection regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. in some cases, new data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's ("eu") general data protection regulation that takes effect in may 2018 and an amended act on the protection of personal information in japan, impose new obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. these new laws may require us to make changes to our services to enable salesforce and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. further, laws such as the european union's proposed e-privacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals' online activities. these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. for example, ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the eu-u.s. and swiss-u.s. privacy shield framework. additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. the markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the crm market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. 11 table of contents additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. in addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; additional stock based compensation; the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages and cultures; currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. any of these risks could harm our business. in addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability 12 table of contents to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. for example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. the interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. for example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa) and related federal communication commission (fcc) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. we are, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa. a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current 13 table of contents enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. our current competitors include: vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers' it departments); marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; e-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services; iot platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. we also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business. our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. the internet's infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. this infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names (icann) and the internet assigned numbers authority (iana), now under the stewardship of icann. the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet, resulting in multiple separate internets. these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. in addition, certain countries have implemented (or may implement) legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet, including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content. these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results. we invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are 14 table of contents dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary impairment, which could be material. we have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results and may harm our business and cause our stock price to decline. all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements; the attrition rates for our services; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our services; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our services to large enterprises; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; the seasonality of our customers' businesses, especially commerce cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the british pound; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; the number of new employees; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; income tax effects, including the impact of changes in u.s. federal and state and international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; 15 table of contents the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards; technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage public and privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; regulatory compliance costs; and the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations, for example, the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ( asu 2014-09 ), which includes the accounting for revenue recognized and capitalized costs. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. in addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with deferred commissions, data center contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations. we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally, include: localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; evolving domestic and international tax environments; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; 16 table of contents compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed. if third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers 17 table of contents may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the pound sterling. we conduct our business in the following regions: the americas, europe, and asia pacific. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling, euro, japanese yen, canadian dollar and australian dollar against the u.s. dollar as well as the euro against the pound sterling. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. additionally, global political events, including the united kingdom's 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union, or brexit, and similar geopolitical developments, have caused global economic uncertainty, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third-party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we 18 table of contents have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have many u.s. patents and pending u.s. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features securely, reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers' success. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. in addition, positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers. in addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising from these facilities could adversely impact our 19 table of contents brand. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. in addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of ohana, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. as our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees' workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees and negatively impact our future growth. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions. we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, and changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. for example, the 2017 u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act") significantly changed income tax law that affect u.s. corporations. we made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of this new law and in our calculations of the provisional amounts reflected in our financial statements. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service ("irs"), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered, and additional accounting guidance or interpretations may be issued in the future that is different from our current interpretation. as we further analyze the new law, and collect relevant 20 table of contents information to complete our computations of the related accounting impact, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. in addition, other countries are considering fundamental tax law changes. any changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also impact our tax liabilities. we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. we have a substantial level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in march 2013 ( 0.25% senior notes ) due april 1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco, california ( 50 fremont ), the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of demandware, due july 2019 (the term loan ) and capital lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. in addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. in july 2016, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and due to limitations within the revolving credit facility and term loan covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings. any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. new lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. in addition, geopolitical developments can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' 21 table of contents purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. while we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to resume operations. current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition, the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting, to alter our operational policies and to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published financial statements. such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. in addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the commerce department's export administration regulations, u.s. customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control. if we fail to comply with these u.s. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, the u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to u.s. sanctions targets, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 22 table of contents risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, both billed and unbilled, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and einstein predictions, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue and earnings per share; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and issuance of debt or other convertible securities. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. in addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. we may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. in addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. 23 table of contents there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. in addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on the notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. the fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. the fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. if, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. in addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; 24 table of contents provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the united states, europe, canada, asia pacific and japan. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar ( usd ). these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. our european revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the british pound. this results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound are first converted into the british pound and then british pounds are translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements. as an example, costs incurred in france are translated from the euro to the british pound and then into the usd. our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. foreign currency transaction risk our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer account receivables, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 ( asc 815 ), derivatives and hedging. accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd. as the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were higher relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion at january 31, 2018 . this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2018 could result in a $33.5 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market 53 table of contents value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion . the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.0 million . market risk and market interest risk we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. in march 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes ( notes ) due in april 2018. holders of the notes may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the notes. the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes. however, the value of the notes is exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price. the principal balance of our notes was $1.03 billion as of january 31, 2018 . the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31, 2018 was $1.8 billion . the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 , which was $170.95 . in july 2016, we amended our credit agreement ( revolving loan credit agreement ) to provide for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ( credit facility ) that matures in july 2021. the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25% , with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. as of january 31, 2018 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit facility. in february 2015, we assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 fremont ( loan ). the loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in june 2023. for the remainder of fiscal 2018, the loan requires interest only payments. beginning in fiscal 2019, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. the loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. the agreement governing the loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of january 31, 2018 . in july 2016, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan ( term loan ) which matures in july 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. we entered into the term loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of demandware. interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate. by entering into the term loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor. the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 2.2% as of january 31, 2018 . changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. we monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. we generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. however, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. as of january 31, 2018 , our portfolio consists of investments in over 200 privately held companies and two public companies, primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $90.0 million , with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10.0 million as of january 31, 2018 . 54 table of contents we invest in early-to-late stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the americas, europe, and asia pacific. we plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive the primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies, accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of mobile applications and connected products. therefore, we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. in certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. currently, one of our publicly held investments is subject to such a contractual obligation, which expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. our strategic investments in privately held companies are primarily in preferred stock of the respective investees and therefore provide us with liquidation preferences in the event there are certain liquidation events. when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable debt at their estimated fair value and equity securities of the privately held companies using the cost method of accounting. otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. as of january 31, 2018 and january 31, 2017 , the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $652.8 million and $526.0 million , respectively. the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $912.0 million and $758.3 million as of january 31, 2018 and january 31, 2017 , respectively. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other-than-temporary, which could be material. we have in the past recorded other than temporary impairments or written off the full value of specific investments. similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. all of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 55 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact. our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and personally identifiable information. while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers' customers' data, our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following: third party attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems; efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states; cyber-attacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate; vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings; vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; vulnerabilities existing within newly acquired or integrated technologies and infrastructures; attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners, or customers; and employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems. these risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. our board of directors, audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cyber-security policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as periodic updates on cyber-security events. although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. for example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage it systems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, possibly resulting in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques; the continued evolution of our internal it systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our it systems; authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers' inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. in the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts and have experienced other security incidents. to date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. 10 table of contents a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our it systems or data, or our customers' systems or data, including intellectual property, proprietary, sensitive, or other confidential information. a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal and financial exposure and liability. finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. as we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase. interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. we use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. for many of our offerings, our production environment and customers' data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. these hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. 11 table of contents privacy concerns and laws such as the european union's general data protection regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. in some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's ("eu") general data protection regulation that took effect in may 2018, impose new obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. in addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ) which will take effect in january 2020, continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens. further, laws such as the european union's proposed e-privacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals' online activities. although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments, such as gdpr and ccpa readiness, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our services to enable salesforce or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. for example, ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the eu-u.s. and swiss-u.s. privacy shield framework. additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. the markets for certain of our offerings, including our einstein artificial intelligence and data integration offerings, remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. in addition, we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers. further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our lightning platform and customer 360 platform, may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings and 12 table of contents develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. in addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. in particular, in may 2018, we completed our largest acquisition to date of mulesoft, for $6.4 billion, which we are continuing to integrate. acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements, and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including: potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all; difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; failure to assimilate acquired employees which may lead to retention risk of both key acquired employees or our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams; differences between our values and those of our acquired companies; difficulties in re-training key employees of acquired companies and integrating them into our organizational structure and corporate culture; difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition; challenges converting and forecasting the acquired company's revenue recognition policies including subscription-based revenues and revenues based on the transfer of control as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products; potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment; increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments; 13 table of contents unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; additional stock-based compensation; the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures and political environments; currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities. any of these risks could harm our business. in addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. for example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regionally-specific, or product-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. the interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. for example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa) and related federal communication commission (fcc) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. we have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa. a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. the additional investments we 14 table of contents are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services requires continuous innovation and is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. our current competitors include: vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers' it departments); marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; e-commerce solutions from established and emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; integration software vendors, integration service providers and api management providers; traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services; iot platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel, and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. we also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing. as a result, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business. our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. the internet's infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. this infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to 15 table of contents provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names (icann) and the internet assigned numbers authority (iana), now under the stewardship of icann. the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet, resulting in multiple separate internets. these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. in addition, certain countries have implemented (or may implement) legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet, including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content. these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital. significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio, including changes in the market prices of our investments in public companies and impairments, could negatively impact our financial results. we invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. upon adoption of asu 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations. as a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. this volatility has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter based on market conditions and events and may cause our stock price to decline. while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio. all of our investments, especially our investments in privately held companies, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements; the attrition rates for our services; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our services; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our services to large enterprises; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; general economic or geopolitical conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; 16 table of contents variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings, including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an on-premise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront; the seasonality of our sales cycle, including software license sales, and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; changes in unearned revenue and the remaining performance obligation, due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term, the timing of license software revenue recognition, or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; the seasonality of our customers' businesses, especially commerce cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the british pound; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; the number of new employees; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; income tax effects, including the impact of changes in u.s. federal and state and international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards; technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held and public companies, which could negatively and materially impact our financial results, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; regulatory compliance costs; and the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations, for example, the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) ( asu 2016-02 ), which includes the accounting for lease assets and lease liabilities. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common 17 table of contents stock could decline. in addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations. we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally, include: localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; evolving domestic and international tax environments; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur; vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; uncertainty regarding regulation, currency, tax, and operations resulting from the brexit vote that could disrupt trade, the sale of our services and commerce, and movement of our people between the united kingdom, european union, and locations; changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale and expand into new markets; treatment of revenue from international sources, intellectual property considerations and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. 18 table of contents any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed. if third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the pound sterling. we conduct our business in the following regions: the americas, europe and asia pacific. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling, euro, japanese yen, canadian dollar and australian dollar against the u.s. dollar as well as the euro against the pound sterling. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. the fluctuations of 19 table of contents currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. additionally, global political events, including the united kingdom's 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union, or brexit, and similar geopolitical developments, fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments, have caused global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to predict our future results and earnings accurately. although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third-party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. 20 table of contents the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have many u.s. patents and pending u.s. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features securely, reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers' success. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. in addition, our services, including ai predictions, may be used by our customers for purposes inconsistent with our company values, which may harm our brand. as with many innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business. further, the development of ai presents emerging ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial, due to their impact, or perceived impact, on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. in addition, positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers. in addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our co-chief executive officers. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive 21 table of contents management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area, where our headquarters are located. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. in addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of ohana, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. as our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees' workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our income tax obligations are generally determined based on our business operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in the earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, changes in accounting principles and tax laws in jurisdictions where we operate. any changes, ambiguity, or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. as our business continues to grow and if we become more profitable, we anticipate that our income tax obligations could significantly increase. if our existing tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards become fully utilized, we may be unable to offset or otherwise mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years. this could have a material impact to our future cash flows or operating results. in addition, recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses, including certain approaches of addressing taxation of digital economy recently proposed or enacted by the organization for economic co-operation and development, the european commission or certain major jurisdictions where we operate might have a material impact to our business and future cash flow from operating activities, or future financial results. we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. in addition, our operations may 22 table of contents change, which may impact our tax liabilities. as our brand becomes increasingly recognizable both domestically and internationally, our tax planning structure and corresponding profile may be subject to increased scrutiny and if we are perceived negatively, we may experience brand or reputational harm. we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. we have a substantial level of debt, including the 2023 and 2028 senior notes we issued in april 2018 ("senior notes ) due april 2023 and april 2028, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco, california ( 50 fremont ) due june 2023, the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of mulesoft, due may 2021 ("2021 term loan") and capital lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments, including operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. in april 2018, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. any required repayment of our debt or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. new lease accounting guidance requires that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these 23 table of contents economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. in addition, geopolitical developments, such as potential trade wars, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, data centers, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our california headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change. climate related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on u.s. critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third party suppliers, or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we have been required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition and the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements. we will have similar requirements related to future accounting pronouncements, such as lease accounting. such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. in addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results. we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the commerce department's export administration regulations, u.s. customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control. if we fail to comply with these u.s. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, the u.s. 24 table of contents export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to u.s. sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and other usage metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital raising transaction; and issuance of debt or other convertible securities. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: 25 table of contents permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the united states, europe, canada, asia pacific and japan. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar ( usd ). these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. our european revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom ("uk") subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the british pound. this results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound are first converted into the british pound and then british pounds are translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements. as an example, costs incurred in france are translated from the euro to the british pound and then into the usd. our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. in fiscal 2020, we will begin transitioning away from this uk-centralized european structure and enable some of our local subsidiaries within europe to invoice customers directly and thereby recognize revenues, operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies. with the change to local invoicing in some markets, we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency thereby reducing our foreign currency exposure. the u.k. held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union ("eu") ( brexit ). in march 2017, the uk government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the eu and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the uk's relationship with the eu. brexit could adversely affect uk, regional (including european) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro. we have evaluated and started to implement initiatives, such as the commitment to invest resources in dublin, ireland, that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operations. in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, total revenues generated in europe were approximately 19 percent , 18 percent and 16 percent of total revenues, respectively, of which substantially all were recorded in our uk subsidiary. revenues in europe increased on a total dollar basis by $35 million and $104 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, respectively, as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling. we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations, and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business. foreign currency transaction risk our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 ( asc 815 ), derivatives and hedging. accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. our ultimate 53 table of contents realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd. although the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and unearned revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the three months using a constant currency rate. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion at january 31, 2019 . this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however, because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2019 could result in a $21 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2018 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion . the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $34 million . market risk and market interest risk we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. in addition, we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): instrument maturity date principal outstanding as of january 31, 2019 interest terms effective interest rate for fiscal 2019 2021 term loan may 2021 $ 500 floating 3.05 % 2023 senior notes april 2023 1,000 fixed 3.26 % 2028 senior notes april 2028 1,500 fixed 3.70 % loan assumed on 50 fremont june 2023 198 fixed 3.75 % revolving credit facility april 2023 0 floating n/a the 2021 term loan bears interest, at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0.625% to 1.25%, in each case, with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. by entering into the 2021 term loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor. changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. the 2021 term loan was signed in april 2018 and funds were received in may 2018. the borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.375% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.375%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.05% to 0.175%, with such rate being based on our public 54 table of contents debt rating, payable in arrears quarterly. as of january 31, 2019 , there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the revolving credit facility. the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. we monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. we generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. however, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. as of january 31, 2019 , our portfolio, which consists of investments in over 235 privately held companies and six public companies, is primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. our investments in these companies range from $0.1 million to approximately $105 million , with 21 investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10 million as of january 31, 2019 . we invest in early-to-late stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. we invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the americas, europe, and asia pacific. we plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive. the primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies, accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of ai, mobile applications and connected products. therefore, we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. in certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. currently, three of our six publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation, which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. upon adoption of asu 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the statement of operations. as such we anticipate additional volatility to our statements of operations in future periods, due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes and impairments of our investments in privately held securities. these changes could be material based on market conditions and events. while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our strategic investments portfolio. in addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. all of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 55 table of contentsrisk factors 8 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact. our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and personally identifiable information. while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers' customers' data, our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following: third-party attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems; efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states; cyber-attacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate; 8 table of contents vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings; vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from newly acquired companies; attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners, or customers; and employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems. these risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. our board of directors, audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cyber-security policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as periodic updates on cyber-security events. although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. for example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage it systems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, possibly resulting in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques; the continued evolution of our internal it systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our it systems; authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers' inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. in the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts and have experienced other security incidents. to date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our it systems or data, or our customers' systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive, or other confidential information. a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal and financial exposure and liability. finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. for example, in fiscal 2020, we experienced a significant service disruption due to an internally deployed software update that had an unintended impact on our services for certain customers. as a precaution, we immediately disabled access to our services for potentially impacted customers while we worked to remediate the issue. upon completion of the evaluation of the cause and impact of the disruption, we determined it did not materially affect our business, reputation or financial results. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our 9 table of contents brand and reputation. as a result, our services may have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. in addition, the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business. as we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase. interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. for many of our offerings, our production environment and customers' data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. these hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. privacy concerns and laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the european union's general data protection regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data, generally. in some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's ("eu") general data protection regulation ("gdpr") that took effect in may 2018, impose obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. in addition, new domestic data privacy laws, such as the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ), which took effect in january 2020, similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both businesses and service providers. as the ccpa continues to evolve and various states introduce similar proposals, we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory burdens. further, laws and legislative proposals such as the eu's proposed e-privacy 10 table of contents regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals' online activities. although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments, such as gdpr and ccpa readiness, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for non-compliance, including as a result of data breaches. these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. for example, ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the eu-u.s. and swiss-u.s. privacy shield framework. additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. by way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under ccpa, and potentially other states' laws, may increase our and our customers' potential liability and the demands our customers place on us. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers and our customers' customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market, such as with analytics and integration, may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. in addition, the markets for certain of our offerings, including einstein analytics and voice, blockchain, and other offerings, remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. in addition, we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers. further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. in addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, 11 table of contents uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements, and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including: potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all; potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment; difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services, and related costs; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; challenges converting the acquired company's revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including subscription-based revenues and software license revenue, as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; the inability to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to complete transactions or to integrate operations, or potential remedies imposed by regulatory authorities either as a condition to or following the completion of a transaction (such as the review of our tableau acquisition by the united kingdom competition &amp; markets authority, which was completed in fiscal 2020), which may include divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies; failure to assimilate acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams; difficulties in re-training key employees of acquired companies and integrating them into our organizational structure and corporate culture; differences between our values and those of our acquired companies; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; challenges with the acquired company's third-party service providers, including those that are required for ongoing access to third-party data; changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition; potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; 12 table of contents potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue; challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments; difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure; additional stock-based compensation, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures and political environments; and the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities. any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations. in addition, to facilitate acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. for example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regionally-specific, or product-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. the interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. this impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized "in country," as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. for example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act ( tcpa ) and related federal communication commission ( fcc ) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. we have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa. a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. 13 table of contents supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, particularly through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. our current competitors include: vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers' it departments); software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, as well as business analytics software companies; integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or api solutions; marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; e-commerce solutions from established and emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services; iot platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and ai solutions from new startups and established companies. in addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel, and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. we also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing. as a result, even if our services are more 14 table of contents effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed including that of trust, customer success, innovation and equality have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features securely, reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers' success. in order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we may make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. in addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. the internet's infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. this infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names ( icann ) and the internet assigned numbers authority ( iana ), now under the stewardship of icann. the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet, resulting in multiple separate internets. these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. in addition, certain countries have implemented (or may implement) legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet, including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content. these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio, including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and privately held companies, could negatively impact our financial results. we have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem has matured, the opportunities in which we can invest have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with an initial public offering in addition to our investments in early to late stage private companies. therefore, our investment strategy and portfolio has also expanded to include more mature companies. in certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be constrained by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a period of time after a public offering, including market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements. we record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations. as a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be 15 table of contents impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time. this volatility has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline. while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio. all of our investments, especially our investments in privately held companies, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. in addition, in the future we may deploy material investments in individual investee companies, resulting in the increasing concentration of risk in a small number of companies. changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements; the attrition rates for our services; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our services; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our services to large enterprises; changes in unearned revenue and the remaining performance obligation, due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term, the collectibility of invoices related to multiyear agreements, the timing of license software revenue recognition, or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; general economic or geopolitical conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings, including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an on-premise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront; the seasonality of our sales cycle, including software license sales, and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; the seasonality of our customers' businesses, especially commerce cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the british pound sterling; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; the number of new employees; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; the cost, timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; 16 table of contents timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; income tax effects resulting from, but not limited to, tax law changes, court decisions on tax matters, global tax developments applicable to multinationals, changes in operations or business structures, and acquisition activity; the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards; technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio; changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held and public companies, which could negatively and materially impact our financial results, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; regulatory compliance costs; and the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. in addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations. we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally, include: localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; 17 table of contents foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; uncertainty regarding regulation, currency, tax, and operations resulting from the united kingdom's exit from the eu ("brexit") on january 31, 2020 and possible disruptions in trade, the sale of our services and commerce, and movement of our people between the united kingdom, eu, and other locations; uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the united states' and other governments' trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs, other restrictions or other geopolitical events; changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale and expand into new markets; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or pandemics, including the ongoing coronavirus epidemic; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and 18 table of contents medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. historically, our subscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees; however, with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau, subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales. we have less experience forecasting the renewal rates of such term software license sales. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed. if third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business. we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the british pound sterling. we primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the americas, europe and asia pacific. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling, euro, japanese yen, canadian dollar and australian dollar against the u.s. dollar as well as the euro against the british pound sterling. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. additionally, global political events, including brexit and similar geopolitical developments, fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments, have caused global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. in addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the coronavirus epidemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. for example, in response to the coronavirus epidemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of it spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. 19 table of contents as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third-party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. social and ethical issues, including the use of ai in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability. social and ethical issues, including the use of new and evolving technologies such as ai in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability. we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings. as with many innovations, ai and our customer 360 platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. for example, the development of ai and customer 360, the latter of which provides information regarding our customers' customers, presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. data practices by us or others that result in controversy could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions. this in turn could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis ai applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. in addition, positions we take on social and ethical issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. we also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue business with existing customers due to these positions. our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability, equality and ethical use, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims, including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers 20 table of contents for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have many u.s. patents and pending u.s. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. for example, in february 2020, keith block resigned as co-ceo and as a director of the company. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area, where our headquarters are located. if we fail to attract new 21 table of contents personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. in addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. as our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees' workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth and operating results. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and recent global tax developments may impact our financial results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in the earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in operations, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. any changes, ambiguity, or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to the business operations including acquisitions. any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results of financial positions. as our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to additional public scrutiny and income tax obligations. furthermore, our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile, and if perceived negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm. as we utilize our tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards, we may be unable to mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years, which could have a material impact to our future cash flows. in addition, changes to our operating structure, including the integration of acquisitions, may result in cash tax obligations. in addition, recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flow from operating activities, or financial results. such developments, for example, include the organization for economic co-operation and development, the european commission, and certain major jurisdictions' taxation of the digital economy. 22 table of contents our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. as of january 31, 2020, we had a substantial level of debt, including the 2023 and 2028 senior notes ("senior notes ), the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco, california ( 50 fremont ) due june 2023 and lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments, such as commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. in april 2018, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. in addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. any required repayment of our debt or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. new lease accounting guidance requires that we now record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which resulted in an increase in both our assets and liabilities. the implementation of this guidance, including the increase in operating and finance lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. these options are reflected in the operating lease right-of-use ("rou") asset, which represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. we reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. the potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics (including the ongoing coronavirus epidemic) and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, it systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. 23 table of contents climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, data centers, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our california headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change. climate related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on u.s. critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and non-financial reporting standards may negatively impact our financial results. we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and interpretations that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we may be required to change our accounting policies, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements. such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit targets, which may negatively impact our financial results. in addition, as we work to align with the recommendations of the financial stability board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures, ("tcfd"), the sustainability accounting standards board ("sasb"), and our own environmental, social, governance ( esg ) materiality assessment, we may expand our disclosures in these areas. this transparency is consistent with our commitment to executing on a strategy that reflects the economic, social, and environmental impact we have on the world while advancing and complementing our business strategy. these metrics, whether it be the standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these metrics, may influence our reputation and the value of our brand. our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth. by electing to set and share publicly these corporate esg metrics, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to esg activities. as a result, we could damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report. any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth. we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. in addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results. we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the commerce department's export administration regulations, u.s. customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control. if we fail to comply with these u.s. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, the u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to u.s. sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results 24 table of contents of operations. risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, year-over-year growth rates for individual service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and other usage metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share, the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including general economic and market conditions and unanticipated delays in the integration of acquired companies as a result of regulatory review; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, including global trade concerns, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital raising transaction; issuance of debt or other convertible securities; and environmental, social, governance and other issues impacting the company's reputation. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); 25 table of contents prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the united states, europe, canada, asia pacific and japan. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers, additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, australian dollar and japanese yen against the united states dollar ( usd ). these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. 46 table of contents our european revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the usd primarily flow through our united kingdom ("uk") subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the british pound sterling. this results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in europe other than the british pound sterling are first remeasured into the british pound sterling and then the british pound sterling is translated into usd for our consolidated financial statements. as an example, costs incurred in france are remeasured from the euro to the british pound sterling and then translated into the usd. our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as usd denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. in fiscal 2020, we began transitioning away from this uk-centralized european structure to enable some of our local subsidiaries within europe, including germany and france, to invoice customers directly. this transition, which may take multiple years, would thereby enable the local subsidiaries to recognize revenues, operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies. with the change to local invoicing in some markets, we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency. in january 2020, the uk exited the european union ( eu ) ( brexit ) and entered a transition period expected to last until the end of calendar 2020 during which the uk will continue to be subject to eu rules and regulations while it negotiates the future terms of its relationship with the eu. brexit, and the outcome of these ongoing negotiations, could adversely affect the uk, regional (including european) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the british pound sterling and euro. we have evaluated and started to implement initiatives, such as the commitment to invest resources in dublin, ireland that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operations. in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 total revenues generated in europe were approximately 20 percent, 19 percent and 18 percent of total revenues, respectively, of which substantially all were recorded in our uk subsidiary. revenues in europe were negatively impacted by approximately $79 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling. we recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiations, and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business. foreign currency transaction risk our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to accounting standards codification 815 ( asc 815 ), derivatives and hedging. accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into usd. although the usd fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and remaining performance obligation that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the fiscal year using a constant currency rate. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $7.9 billion at january 31, 2020. this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 47 table of contents our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however, because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at january 31, 2020 could result in a $38 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $21 million. market risk and market interest risk we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. in addition, we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): instrument maturity date principal outstanding as of january 31, 2020 interest terms effective interest rate for fiscal 2020 2023 senior notes april 2023 $ 1,000 fixed 3.26% 2028 senior notes april 2028 1,500 fixed 3.70% loan assumed on 50 fremont june 2023 194 fixed 3.75% revolving credit facility april 2023 0 floating n/a the borrowings under our revolving credit facility ( credit facility ) bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.375% or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.375%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. our revolving credit facility allows for the libor rate to be phased-out and replaced with the secured overnight financing rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming libor transition. regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.05% to 0.175%, with such rate being based on our credit rating, payable in arrears quarterly. as of january 31, 2020, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the credit facility. the bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. we monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. we generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. however, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally. we primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators to create and expand our ecosystem. as the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change, our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings, as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies. we plan to continue these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive. as of january 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of investments in over 260 companies, with capital investments ranging from less than $0.3 million to approximately $300 million, and 27 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10 million. the following table sets forth additional information regarding active investments within our strategic investment 48 table of contents portfolio as of january 31, 2020 and excludes exited investments (in millions): investment type capital invested unrealized gains (cumulative) unrealized losses (cumulative) carrying value as of january 31, 2020 publicly held equity securities $ 249 $ 142 $ (21) $ 370 privately held equity securities 1,288 448 (193) 1,543 total equity securities $ 1,537 $ 590 $ (214) $ 1,913 we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to our investments. these changes could be material based on market conditions and events. while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio. our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and preferences. the particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total company value. as such, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. for example, an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our significant publicly traded and privately held equity securities held as of january 31, 2020, which represents 65% of the strategic investment portfolio, could result in a $97 million reduction to the investment portfolio. fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment. we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. in certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. currently, two of our five publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation, which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. in addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. all of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital. 49 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound, canadian dollar and japanese yen. we have a risk management policy that allows us to utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. to date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows. if we were to enter into hedging contracts, the contracts by policy would have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. additionally, by policy we would not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million at january 31, 2005. these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. the unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in higher interest income of $0.8 million offset by a principal reduction of $1.6 million for a net reduction of $0.8 million over a 12-month period. similarly, a 100-basis point decrease could result in a decrease in interest income of $0.8 million and a principal increase of $1.6 million for a net increase of $0.8 million. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. 47 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors risk factors which may impact future operating results risks related to our business and industry if our on-demand application service is not widely accepted, our operating results will be harmed. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our on-demand application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. as a result, widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future growth and success. factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include: reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an on-demand application service; a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings; the price and performance of our service; the level of customization we can offer; the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; 14 table of contents reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability, reliability or security of on-demand application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and adverse statements made by competitors. many of these factors are beyond our control. the inability of our on-demand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business. defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. as of january 31, 2006, we serve all of our customers from a single, third-party web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states, operated by equinix, inc. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate standby equinix facility located on the east coast. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. in addition to the west coast and east coast facilities, we have an agreement with sungard data systems, a provider of availability services, to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us with access to hardware, software and internet connectivity in the event the web hosting facilities become unavailable. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. as we continue to add data center capacity, we may move or transfer data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue 15 table of contents to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. if our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for crm applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, several of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. if we fail to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed. some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. if we are unable to maintain our current pricing, our operating results could be negatively impacted. in addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. our current principal competitors include: enterprise software application vendors including amdocs limited, ssa global technologies, inc., which recently acquired e.piphany, inc., epicor, ibm corporation, microsoft corporation, sap ag, and oracle corporation, which recently acquired siebel systems, inc.; packaged crm software vendors, some of whom offer hosted services, such as frontrange solutions, inc., onyx software corp., pivotal corporation, which is owned by cdc software corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, sage group plc, and sugarcrm; on-demand crm application service providers such as oracle, sap, netsuite, inc., rightnow technologies, inc., and salesnet, inc.; and enterprise application service providers including british telecom and ibm. in addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle crm products with their products in the future. for small business customers, we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality. we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors, but who also have directly competitive on-demand crm application services offerings, such as siebel systems siebel crm ondemand, which was acquired by oracle. our 16 table of contents professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including accenture ltd., bearingpoint, inc. and ibm, as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations. we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements. many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations, our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice. due to our limited operating history, our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations. as a result, we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: the requirement to begin expensing stock options on february 1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007; our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; changes in our pricing policies; the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and effectiveness of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; 17 table of contents technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to our new data centers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in tax rates and adjustments to the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets; general economic conditions in our geographic markets; the timing of additional investments in our on-demand application service and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; payment defaults by customers; costs associated with future acquisitions of companies and technologies; and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments. some of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future. we incurred significant losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in february 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we have begun generating profits only since fiscal 2003. as we are a relatively young company in an emerging market and with the new requirement to begin expensing stock options in fiscal 2007, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may again incur significant operating losses in the future. in addition, we expect our costs and operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs and operating expenses, we will not continue to be profitable. you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. in fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline. furthermore, if our costs and operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. as a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. the market for our technology delivery model and on-demand application services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be harmed. the market for on-demand application services is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand application services in general, and for crm in particular. many enterprises have invested substantial personnel 18 table of contents and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an on-demand application service. furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on-demand application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. in addition, as a new company in this unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business. we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in fiscal 2006, we introduced the appexchange directory, a central online marketplace for on-demand applications that we host for our customers, developers and partners to exchange custom on-demand applications that are built on, or can integrate with, our service. these custom applications, some of which are not crm-related, include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting. although we do not presently charge for use of the appexchange directory, it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers, developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service. we do not have an adequate history with our subscription model to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact, some customers have elected not to do so. in addition, our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions. we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates. our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. if these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any 19 table of contents future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. if we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses, which have a greater rate of attrition and non-renewal than medium-sized and large enterprise customers. our small business customers, which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees, typically have shorter initial subscription periods and, based on our limited experience to date, have had a higher rate of attrition and non-renewal as compared to our medium-sized and large enterprise customers. if we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough, our revenue could decline. our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large customers. our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large businesses. our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful. in particular, because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history, these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical crm applications from one of our larger, more established competitors. even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers, they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service, which could harm our business. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers, all of which could harm our business. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our service. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. in addition, larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable. if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and 20 table of contents development expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. any efforts we may make in the future to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed. to date, we have focused our business on providing on-demand application services for the crm market, but we may in the future seek to expand into other markets. in addition, we recently launched the appexchange directory, an on-line marketplace for on-demand applications running on our on-demand application service platform. however, any efforts to expand beyond the crm market may never result in significant revenue growth for us. in addition, efforts to expand our on-demand application service beyond the crm market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business. if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. through january 31, 2006, we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date, and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses; and the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline. if we fail to develop our brand cost-effectively, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. in the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense. brand promotion activities 21 table of contents may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth. we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. new hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. in addition, we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging third-party resellers. because of our on-demand service model, the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business, financial and other resources. if we are unable to structure successful third-party channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering, our growth will be inhibited. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; foreign currency fluctuations, whose effects we may not be able to mitigate through our hedging program; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in u.s. dollars and paid in local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. 22 table of contents any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have u.s. and international patent applications pending, we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection for our technology. in addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others. we may be required to purchase the interest in our japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner, under certain circumstances, on terms that may not be favorable to us. in some circumstances, we may be required to purchase the interest of our japanese joint venture partner. if we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner, or if we and our partner disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues, then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture. in the event we are required to purchase our partner interest in the joint venture, we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital, which could harm our financial condition. although the timing and circumstances of any such purchase, were it to be required, are not predictable, if the joint venture were valued based on its most recent financing, which occurred in september 2003, the buyout price could be as much as approximately $13.0 million. evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and 23 table of contents restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business. privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. for example, regulations such as the gramm-leach-bliley act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including the securities and exchange commission, new york stock exchange and public company accounting oversight board, that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. our efforts to comply with these new regulations, most notably the sarbanes-oxley act, or sox, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. we are required to comply on an on-going basis with the sox requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent public accountants audit of that assessment. these requirements first became applicable to us on january 31, 2006. our efforts to comply with the sox requirements has required, and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources. moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. 24 table of contents we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly marc benioff, our chief executive officer and chairman of the board, steve cakebread, our chief financial officer, jim steele, our president of worldwide sales and distribution, parker harris, our executive vice president of technology, ken juster, our executive vice president of law, policy and corporate strategy, and john freeland, our president of worldwide operations. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. to continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services and senior sales executives. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. in addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. furthermore, the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. we might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available. we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. in addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our reported results of operations. in december 2004, the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options. the pro forma disclosures that the fasb previously permitted 25 table of contents will no longer be an alternative to the financial statement recognition of the expense. we will adopt this new accounting pronouncement, statement of financial accounting standards no. 123 (revised 2004), share-based payment , on a prospective basis beginning on february 1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007. we believe this change in accounting will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. we expect our tax rate in fiscal 2007 to be significantly higher than in previous years. the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the tax accounting for option activities pursuant to the new requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. risks related to ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. further, our common stock has a limited trading history. factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results and cash flows; the quarterly net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems or due to a natural disaster, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation, such as the lawsuits following the approximately 25% decline in our stock price on july 21, 2004, which may harm our business and results of operations. if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts. if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. 26 table of contents the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. our executive officers, directors, current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. as a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2 / 3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt; eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar and japanese yen. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million at january 31, 2006. these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $1.6 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million. 47 table of contentsrisk factors 15 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry if our on-demand application service is not widely accepted, our operating results will be harmed. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our on-demand application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. as a result, widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future growth and success. factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include: reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an on-demand application service; a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings; the price and performance of our service; the level of customization we can offer; the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability, reliability or security of on-demand application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and adverse statements made by competitors. many of these factors are beyond our control. the inability of our on-demand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business. defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. 15 table of contents interruptions or delays in service from our third-party web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. as of january 31, 2007, we serve our customers from a third-party web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate standby facility located on the east coast. features added through acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. as we continue to add data center capacity, we may move or transfer data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. if our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. in addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our appexchange directory, access to their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party appexchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party appexchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. 16 table of contents the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for crm applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, several of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. if we fail to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed. some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. if we are unable to maintain our current pricing, our operating results could be negatively impacted. in addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. our current principal competitors include: enterprise software application vendors including amdocs limited, infor global solutions, epicor, ibm corporation, microsoft corporation, sap ag, and oracle corporation; packaged crm software vendors, some of whom offer hosted services, such as frontrange solutions, inc., made2manage systems inc., pivotal corporation, which is owned by cdc software corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, sage group plc, and sugarcrm; on-demand crm application service providers such as oracle, sap, netsuite, inc., rightnow technologies, inc.; and enterprise application service providers including british telecom and ibm. in addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle crm products with their products in the future. for small business customers, we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality. we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors, but who also have directly competitive on-demand crm application services offerings. our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including accenture ltd., bearingpoint, inc. and ibm, as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations. we have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements. many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. 17 table of contents if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations, our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice. due to our limited operating history, our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations. as a result, we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: the adverse financial statement impact of having to expense stock options, which is now required of us effective february 1, 2006; our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; changes in our pricing policies; the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and effectiveness of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to increasing our data center capacity; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in tax rates and adjustments to the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets; general economic conditions in our geographic markets; the timing of additional investments in our on-demand application service and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies; 18 table of contents the timing of non-income tax expense which is triggered when employees in foreign jurisdictions exercise their vested stock options; and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments. some of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future. we have incurred significant operating losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in february 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we have begun generating profits only since fiscal 2003. as we are a relatively young company in an emerging market and with the requirement to expense stock options, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant operating losses in the future. in addition, we expect our costs and operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs and operating expenses, we will not continue to be profitable. you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. in fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline. furthermore, if our costs and operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. as a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. the market for our technology delivery model and on-demand application services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be harmed. the market for on-demand application services is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand application services in general, and for crm in particular. many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an on-demand application service. furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on-demand application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. in addition, as a new company in this unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business. we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. 19 table of contents our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in fiscal 2006, we introduced the appexchange directory, a central online marketplace for on-demand applications that we host for our customers, developers and partners to exchange custom on-demand applications that are built on, or can integrate with, our service. these custom applications, some of which are not crm-related, include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting. although we do not presently charge for use of the appexchange directory, it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers, developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service. we have limited history with our subscription model to accurately predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact, some customers have elected not to do so. in addition, our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions. we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multi-year contracts, so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates. our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. if these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we are currently experiencing a period of increasing headcount and rapid growth in our operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. if we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. we derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses, which have a greater rate of attrition and non-renewal than medium-sized and large enterprise customers. our small business customers, which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees, typically have shorter initial subscription periods and, based on our limited experience to date, have had a higher rate of attrition and non-renewal as compared to our medium-sized and large enterprise customers. if we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough, our revenue could decline. 20 table of contents our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large customers. our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large businesses. our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful. in particular, because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history, these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical crm applications from one of our larger, more established competitors. even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers, they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service, which could harm our business. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers, all of which could harm our business. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. in addition, larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable. if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. efforts we are making to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may cause us to incur additional liabilities. we introduced the appexchange directory in fiscal 2006, an on-line marketplace for on-demand applications that run on our apex on-demand application service platform. the market for third-party on-demand applications and our platform is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether the initiative will ever result in significant revenue for us. among other things, the success of apex will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of third-party technology providers to write on-demand applications that run on our platform and the 21 table of contents willingness of enterprises, large and small, to purchase and deploy these applications. if third-party technology providers or enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our on-line application marketplace, then the market for this initiative may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would affect our ability to generate revenue. given this new and unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect this initiative. in addition, our customers may authorize such third-party technology providers to access their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party technology providers or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. further, despite contract provisions designed to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. moreover, the appexchange directory, and other efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market, may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business. as we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses; and the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline. if we fail to develop our brand cost-effectively, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive 22 table of contents prices. in the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth. we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. new hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. in addition, we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging third-party resellers. because of our on-demand service model, the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business, financial and other resources. if we are unable to structure successful third-party channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering, our growth will be inhibited. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together have historically represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data to the united states; foreign currency fluctuations, whose effects we may not be able to mitigate through our hedging program; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 23 table of contents additionally, some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in u.s. dollars and paid in local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have u.s. and international patent applications pending, we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection for our technology. in addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others. evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business. 24 table of contents privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. for example, regulations such as the gramm-leach-bliley act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including the securities and exchange commission, new york stock exchange and public company accounting oversight board, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. we are required to comply on an on-going basis with the sarbanes-oxley act, or sox, requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent public accountants audit of that assessment. these requirements first became applicable to us on january 31, 2006. our efforts to comply with the sox requirements have required, and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources. moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. 25 table of contents we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. to continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services and senior sales executives. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. in addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. furthermore, the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates require to join our company. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. we might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available. we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. in addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. we may be required to purchase the interest in our japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner, under certain circumstances, on terms that may not be favorable to us. in some circumstances, we may be required to purchase the interest of our japanese joint venture partner. if we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner, or if we and our partner 26 table of contents disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues, then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture. in the event we are required to purchase our partner interest in the joint venture, we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital, which could harm our financial condition. expensing stock options will continue to adversely affect our reported results of operations. effective february 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no. 123 (as revised), share-based payment , or sfas 123r. sfas 123r requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. as a result of implementing sfas 123r, we recognized stock-based expense of $39.2 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the year ended january 31, 2007. we believe this change in accounting will continue to materially reduce our future reported results of operations. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. our tax rate in fiscal 2007 is significantly higher than in previous years. the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from the new requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. risks related to ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. for example, during the year ended january 31, 2007, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a closing price of $21.85 to $44.00 per share. further, our common stock has a limited trading history. factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results and cash flows; the quarterly net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions, either independently or as compared with publicly published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems or due to a natural disaster, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event. 27 table of contents in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation, such as the lawsuits filed following the approximately 25% decline in our stock price on july 21, 2004, which may harm our business and results of operations. if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts. if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. our executive officers, directors, current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. as a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2 / 3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt; eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 28 table of contents in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, japanese yen and australian dollar. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million at january 31, 2007. these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $2.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million. 49 table of contentsrisk factors 16 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from a third-party web hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states and we plan to begin to serve some customers from a third-party web hosting facility located on the east coast of the united states. additionally, we plan to add a data center outside the united states during fiscal 2009. as we continue to add capacity in our existing and future data centers, we may move or transfer data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate standby facility located on the east coast. features added through acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue 16 table of contents to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. if our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our data or our customers data, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers data, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and a loss of confidence in the security of our service that would harm our future business prospects. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. in addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our appexchange directory, to access their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party appexchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party appexchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. if our on-demand application service is not widely accepted in markets where we have few customers, our future growth and success will be limited. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our on-demand application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. as a result, widespread acceptance of our service by companies located outside the united states or in industries where we currently have few customers is critical to our future growth and success. factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include: reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an on-demand application service; a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings; the price and performance of our service; the level of customization we can offer; the location of our data centers; the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability, reliability or security of on-demand application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and our competitors. many of these factors are beyond our control. the inability of our on-demand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business. 17 table of contents efforts we are making to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and cause us to incur additional liabilities. in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory, an on-line marketplace for on-demand applications that run on our force.com on-demand application service platform. the market for third-party on-demand applications and our platform is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether the initiative will ever result in significant revenue for us. among other things, the success of the appexchange will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of third-party technology providers to write on-demand applications that run on our platform and the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to purchase and deploy these applications. if third-party technology providers or enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our on-line application marketplace, then the market for this initiative may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would affect our ability to grow our revenue. given this new and unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect this initiative. in addition, our customers may not authorize such third-party technology providers to access their customer data. if our customers do authorize such access, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. further, despite contract provisions designed to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. moreover, the appexchange directory, and other efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market, may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for crm, enterprise business applications, and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software, whose software is installed by the customer directly and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current principal competitors include: enterprise software application vendors including amdocs limited, epicor software corporation, ibm corporation, infor global solutions, microsoft corporation, oracle corporation, and sap ag; packaged crm software vendors, some of which offer hosted services, such as cdc software corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, consona corporation (formerly made2manage systems inc.), frontrange solutions, inc., pivotal corporation, which is owned by, sage group plc, and sugarcrm; on-demand crm application service providers such as oracle corporation, netsuite, inc., rightnow technologies, inc., and sap ag; enterprise application service providers including ibm corporation; platform and development environment companies, including established vendors, such as ibm corporation, oracle corporation (formerly including bea software) and microsoft corporation; and an array of emerging vendors that have gained traction with the press and analyst communities. in addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle crm products with their products in the future. for small business customers, we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality. we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who 18 table of contents historically have been packaged crm software vendors, but who also have directly competitive on-demand crm application services offerings. our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including accenture ltd., bearingpoint, inc., deloitte consulting and ibm corporation as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in crm implementations. we have close relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements. many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of intense competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to increasing our data center capacity and expanding our data centers domestically and internationally; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the effective tax rates; 19 table of contents general economic conditions could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our application service, which could adversely affect our operating results; the timing of additional investments in our on-demand application service and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; the adverse financial statement impact of having to expense stock options; and the timing of payroll and social tax expense which is triggered when employees in foreign jurisdictions exercise their vested stock options. many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed and our stock price may decline without advance notice. due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the rate of new or renewed subscriptions falls short of our expectations. as a result, we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. the market for our technology delivery model and on-demand application services is immature and volatile, and if it develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. the market for on-demand application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market 20 table of contents acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand application services in general, and for crm in particular. many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an on-demand application service. furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on-demand application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. in addition, as a new company in this unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business. we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in fiscal 2006, we introduced the appexchange directory, a central online marketplace for on-demand applications that we host for our customers, developers and partners to exchange custom on-demand applications that are built on, or can integrate with, our service. these custom applications, some of which are not crm-related, include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting. it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers, developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service. we cannot accurately predict customer subscription renewal rates and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions or renew for shorter contract lengths. we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multi-year contracts. our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. if these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience a period of increasing headcount and growth in our operations to support a growing customer base, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, further development of our service, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. to manage the expected 21 table of contents growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. the additional headcount and capital investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues. we periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, sales performance, increases in sales headcount and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail 22 table of contents significant expense. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have two u.s. patents and many other u.s. patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others. if we fail to develop our brands cost-effectively, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable secure and useful services at competitive prices. in the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth. we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. we believe that there is significant competition for 23 table of contents direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. new hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. in addition, we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging third-party resellers. because of our on-demand service model, the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business, financial and other resources. if we are unable to structure successful third-party channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering, our growth will be inhibited. our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners. our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, both with respect to our crm service and platform and the professional services that customize our crm service and platform to meet our customers business needs. professional services may be performed by our own staff, or by a third party or a combination of the two. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together have historically represented over 20 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; foreign currency fluctuations; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 24 table of contents additionally, some of our international subscription fees are currently paid in local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business. privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. for example, in the united states regulations such as the gramm-leach-bliley act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. many if not most other jurisdictions, including asia countries, have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the securities and exchange commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies 25 table of contents whose securities are publicly traded. our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. we are required to comply on an on-going basis with the sarbanes-oxley act, or sox, requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. our efforts to comply with the sox requirements have required, and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources. moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. to continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services and senior sales executives. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. furthermore, the cost to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join our company. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 26 table of contents as we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses; and the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. our effective tax rate has experienced significant fluctuations over the past fiscal year in comparison to previous years. the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from the requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. the internal revenue service initiated an examination of the company federal income tax return for fiscal 2006. this audit may be completed within the next 12 months. while it is difficult to predict the final outcome of any particular uncertain tax position, management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months. risks related to ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. for example, during the three months ended january 31, 2008, the trading price of our common stock has ranged 27 table of contents from a closing price of $48.53 to $64.99 per share. factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results and cash flows from operating activities and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; the net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems; market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts. if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or lower their future stock price targets or estimates of our operating results, our stock price could decline rapidly. furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. our executive officers, directors, and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. as a result, these stockholders, if they act together or in a block, could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. 28 table of contents provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement stockholder rights (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, japanese yen and australian dollar. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million at january 31, 2008. these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $3.2 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $2.8 million. 49 table of contentsrisk factors 15 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from a third-party data center hosting facility located on the west coast of the united states and we plan to begin to serve some customers from a third-party data center hosting facility located on the east coast of the united states. additionally, we plan to begin serving customers from a new data center hosting facility we will be opening in singapore in fiscal 2010. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. as we continue to add capacity in our existing and future data centers, we may move or transfer data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue 15 table of contents credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate standby facility located on the east coast. features added through acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. if our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our data or our customers data, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers data, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and a loss of confidence in the security of our service that would harm our future business prospects. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. in addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our appexchange directory, to access their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party appexchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party appexchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. weakening global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies are currently undergoing a period of severe recession, characterized by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, going concern threats to financial institutions and major multi-national companies, poor liquidity, declining asset values, reduced corporate profitability, extreme volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets and increased bankruptcies. these conditions could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing application service, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. companies that have competing products may reduce prices for competing products or services which could also reduce our average selling prices and harm our operating results. 16 table of contents because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet and the revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed and our stock price may decline without advance notice. due to our evolving business model, the unpredictability of new markets that we enter and deteriorating general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the rate of new or renewed subscriptions falls short of our expectations. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we cannot accurately predict customer subscription renewal rates and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions or renew for shorter contract lengths. we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multi-year contracts. our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service, their ability to continue their operations and spending levels and deteriorating general economic and financial market conditions. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. if these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price 17 table of contents may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. some of the important factors that could cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of intense competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to increasing our data center capacity and expanding our data centers domestically and internationally; changes in foreign currency exchange rates (as an example, recently the value of the euro and british pound have decreased against the u.s. dollar by approximately 13 percent and 28 percent, respectively from a year ago, and as such, our revenue results outside the americas in fiscal 2009 have been negatively impacted); changes in interest rates, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities (as an example, the yield on the 2 year u.s. treasury bill has declined approximately 120 basis points from a year ago to 1.005 percent); conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; changes in the effective tax rates; general economic conditions could adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase our application service or delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results; the seasonal nature of our invoicing, timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application service and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies, such as our august 2008 acquisition of instranet, inc.; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their 4 year vesting schedules. 18 table of contents many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. efforts we are making to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and cause us to incur additional liabilities. in fiscal 2006 we introduced the appexchange directory, an on-line marketplace for enterprise cloud computing applications that run on our force.com cloud computing platform. the market for third-party on-demand applications and our platform is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether the initiative will ever result in significant revenue for us. among other things, the success of the appexchange will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of third-party technology providers to write enterprise cloud computing applications that run on our platform and the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to purchase and deploy these applications. if third-party technology providers or enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our on-line application marketplace, then the market for this initiative may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would affect our ability to grow our revenue. given this new and unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect this initiative. in addition, our customers may not authorize such third-party technology providers to access their customer data. if our customers do authorize such access, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. further, despite contract provisions designed to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. moreover, the appexchange directory, and other efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market, may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business. the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing application services is immature and volatile, and if it develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. the market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general, and for crm in particular. many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. our success also depends on the willingness of third- 19 table of contents party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for crm, enterprise business applications, and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software, whose software is installed by the customer directly, and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current principal competitors include: enterprise software application vendors including microsoft corporation, oracle corporation, and sap ag; packaged crm software vendors, some of which offer hosted services, such as cdc software corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, consona corporation (formerly made2manage systems inc.), pivotal corporation, which is owned by sage group plc, and sugarcrm; on-demand crm application service providers such as microsoft corporation, netsuite, inc., oracle corporation, rightnow technologies, inc., and sap ag; enterprise application service providers including ibm corporation and oracle corporation; traditional platform and development environment companies, including established vendors, such as ibm corporation, microsoft corporation, and oracle corporation; and an array of emerging vendors that have gained traction with the press and analyst communities; and cloud computing development platform companies, including some with whom we are partners, others such as microsoft corporation, which has initiated plans to enter this market, and a variety of smaller start up companies that have invested in cloud computing technology. in addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own crm applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle crm products with their products in the future. for small business customers, we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on microsoft outlook and excel for limited contact management functionality. we also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged crm software vendors, but who also have directly competitive on-demand crm application services offerings. our professional services organization may compete with some systems integrators, including accenture ltd., deloitte consulting and ibm corporation; it may also compete with some isv service providers that have service practices. we have close relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them. many of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater 20 table of contents financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. if our enterprise cloud computing application service is not widely accepted in markets where we have few customers, our future growth will be limited. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. as a result, widespread acceptance of our service by companies located outside the united states or in industries where we currently have few customers is critical to our future growth. factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include: reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings; the price and performance of our service; the level of customization we can offer; the location of our data centers; the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability, reliability or security of enterprise cloud computing application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and our competitors. many of these factors are beyond our control. the inability of our enterprise cloud computing application service to achieve widespread market acceptance as described above would harm our business. our past and anticipated future growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we have experienced and may continue to experience a period of increasing headcount and growth in our operations to support a growing customer base, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure will be required to address increases in our customer base, further development of our service, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. if our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. the additional 21 table of contents headcount and capital investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues. we periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or 22 table of contents invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have a few u.s. patents and many other u.s. patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others. if we fail to develop our brands cost-effectively, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable secure and useful services at competitive prices. in the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth. we continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. our ability to achieve 23 table of contents significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. new hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. in addition, we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging third-party resellers. because of our enterprise cloud computing service model, the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business, financial and other resources. if we are unable to structure successful third-party channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering, our growth will be inhibited. our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners. our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, both with respect to our crm service and platform and the professional services that customize our crm service and platform to meet our customers business needs. professional services may be performed by our own staff, or by a third party or a combination of the two. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together represent over 25 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; foreign currency fluctuations; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; regional economic conditions, including the affect of general economic and financial market conditions in the markets in which we operate outside the united states; and regional political conditions. 24 table of contents any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, some of our international subscription fees are currently paid in local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business. privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. for example, in the united states regulations such as the gramm-leach-bliley act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. many if not most other jurisdictions, including asia countries, have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. 25 table of contents we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. to continue to execute on our business plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services and senior sales executives. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. volatility in the price of our stock and the cost to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join or stay with our company. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. as we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock. as part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. in august 2008, we acquired instranet, inc. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining quality standards consistent with our brand; 26 table of contents potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline. our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the securities and exchange commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. we are required to comply on an on-going basis with the sarbanes-oxley act, or sox, requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. our efforts to comply with the sox requirements have required, and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources. moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. our effective tax rate has fluctuated over the past fiscal year. the tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from stock option compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, and other events beyond our 27 table of contents control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks related to ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. for example, during the year ended january 31, 2009, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a closing price of $21.96 to $74.43 per share. factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; the net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; and trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. if securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. we do not control these analysts. if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or lower their future stock price targets or estimates of our operating results, our 28 table of contents stock price could decline rapidly. furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. our executive officers, directors, and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. as a result, these stockholders, if they act together or in a block, could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2 / 3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement stockholder rights (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, japanese yen and australian dollar. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. prior to october 31, 2008, our practice was to settle foreign currency contracts prior to each quarter end because the maturities of the foreign currency contracts were less than 3 months. we have continued our practice of entering into foreign currency contracts with maturities less than 3 months. as of january 31, 2009 the contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million at january 31, 2009. these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no. 115, accounting for investments in debt and equity securities . all of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no. 115. our marketable securities include corporate notes and obligations, u.s. treasuries, u.s. agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed securities and money market mutual funds. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2009 could result in a $2.3 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model 53 table of contents that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. as previously discussed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources, we have an investment in the reserve fund, a money market mutual fund. while we believe we have the rights to the recovery of our entire investment, we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive. at january 31, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $3.2 million. 54 table of contentsrisk factors 13 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located on the west and east coasts of the united states. additionally, we recently started serving customers from a new data center hosting facility in singapore. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located on the east coast. features added through 13 table of contents acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. these security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our data or our customers data. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers data. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our appexchange directory, to access their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party appexchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party appexchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, going concern threats to major multinational companies and medium and small businesses, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing application service, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be 14 table of contents recognized over the applicable subscription term. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. we cannot accurately predict renewal rates, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multi-year contracts and for our small and medium size business customers. our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers ability to continue their operations and spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to our evolving business model, the unpredictability of new markets that we enter and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. during fiscal 2009, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we were infringing some of their patents. we continue to analyze the potential merits of their claims, the potential defenses to such claims and potential counter claims, and the possibility of a license agreement as an alternative to litigation. we are currently in discussions with this company and no litigation has been filed to date. however, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. the resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims 15 table of contents against their use. the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. any intellectual property claims, including the one referenced above, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all. in addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter. our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; the number of new employees added; changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of intense competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to increasing our data center capacity and expanding our data centers domestically and internationally; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; changes in the effective tax rates; 16 table of contents general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application service and in our consulting service; changes in deferred revenue balances due to the seasonal nature of our customer invoicing, changes in the average duration of our invoices, rate of renewals and the rate of new business growth; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules. many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, we may also fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, and the market price of our common stock. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. as we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. as part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining quality standards consistent with our brand; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; 17 table of contents unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our common stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. if the market for our technology delivery model and an enterprise cloud computing application service develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. the market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general, and for crm in particular. many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize third-party technology partners access to their data, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. 18 table of contents the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software, whose software is installed by the customer directly, and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current principal competitors include: enterprise software application vendors including microsoft corporation, oracle corporation, and sap ag; on-demand crm application service providers such as microsoft corporation, netsuite, inc., oracle corporation, rightnow technologies, inc. and sap ag; enterprise application service providers including ibm corporation and oracle corporation; traditional platform development environment companies, including established vendors, such as ibm corporation, microsoft corporation, and oracle corporation; and cloud computing development platform companies, including some with whom we are partners, others such as microsoft corporation, which has initiated plans to enter this market, and a variety of smaller start up companies that have invested in cloud computing technology. many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the market for our force.com cloud computing platform is new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. since we were formed in 1999, we have experienced significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to scale our 19 table of contents operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, and to expand into new geographic areas. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues. we periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. if we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. 20 table of contents our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners. our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, both with respect to our crm service and platform and the professional services that customize our crm service and platform to meet our customers business needs. professional services may be performed by our own staff, or by a third party or a combination of the two. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have a few u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. if we fail to develop our brands, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. in the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31, 2010, 21 table of contents and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; regional economic conditions; and regional political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. in addition, taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed. any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet-based services, which could harm our business. privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to 22 table of contents resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. for example, in the united states regulations such as the gramm-leach-bliley act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. many other jurisdictions have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. we are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our operations and growing customer base. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. if our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain highly skilled employees. in addition, since we expense all stock-based compensation, we may periodically change our stock compensation practices, which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for options or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 23 table of contents our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. we are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the securities and exchange commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. if we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from share-based compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles. increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. in addition, we are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to ownership of our common stock and our convertible senior notes due 2015 the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; 24 table of contents forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; the net increases in the number of customers, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; and any other factors discussed herein. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources. the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. our executive officers, directors, and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. as a result, these stockholders, if they act together or in a block, could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; 25 table of contents provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. as a result of our sale of $575.0 million of 0.75 percent convertible senior notes in january 2010 (the notes ), we now have long-term debt that we have not had to maintain in the past. our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because: it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal in 2015; it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. we expect that the trading price of the notes will be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock, which may be volatile, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality. the market price of our common stock, as well as the general level of interest rates and our credit quality, will likely significantly affect the trading price of the notes. our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. we cannot predict whether the market price of our common stock will rise or fall. the market price of our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows, deferred revenue, other financial and non-financial metrics and other factors described in greater detail elsewhere in this section, many of which are beyond our control. the market price of our common stock also could be affected by possible sales of common stock by investors who view the notes as an attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage 26 table of contents activity involving our common stock that we expect to develop as a result of the issuance of the notes. the hedging or arbitrage activity could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the notes. we also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall. during the term of the notes, interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. however, if interest rates increase, the option value of the notes convertibility feature will increase, but the yield of the notes will decrease, and if interest rates decrease, the option value of the notes convertibility feature will decrease, but the yield of the notes will increase. in addition, our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the notes and will be influenced by a number of factors, including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding. any decrease in our credit quality could negatively impact the trading price of the notes. we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. in addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, the anticipated conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. the notes and the indenture that will govern the notes contain limited protections against certain types of important corporate events and may not protect your investment upon the occurrence of such corporate events and will not protect your investment upon the occurrence of other corporate events. the indenture for the notes does not: require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flows or liquidity; protect holders of the notes in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations; limit our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness that would effectively rank senior to the notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness; limit our ability to incur indebtedness that is equal in right of payment to the notes; limit our ability to incur indebtedness with a maturity date earlier than the maturity date of the notes; restrict our subsidiaries ability to issue securities or incur liability that would be structurally senior to our indebtedness; restrict our ability to purchase or prepay our securities; or restrict our ability to make investments or to purchase or pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our common stock or other securities ranking junior to the notes. furthermore, the indenture for the notes contains only limited protections in the event of a change in control. we could engage in many types of transactions, such as certain acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that could substantially affect our capital structure and the value of the notes and our common 27 table of contents stock, but would not constitute a fundamental change that permits holders to require us to purchase their notes under the indenture. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to re-pay the notes. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. in addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. in addition, if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture. our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes. the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. the fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the issuance of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. as the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions, their activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we may become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. 28 table of contents our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds from our debt issuance and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. our management will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from debt issuance, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. they might not apply the net proceeds of this offering in ways that increase the value of your investment. we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures; however, other than paying the cost of the convertible note hedge (after taking into account the proceeds from the warrant transactions), we have not allocated these net proceeds for any specific purposes. our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, japanese yen and australian dollar. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion at january 31, 2010. this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2010 could result in a $13.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity 52 table of contents model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $2.3 million. market risk and market interest risk in january 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the notes ). holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes. amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedges transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. our notes have fixed annual interest rates at 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our notes. however, the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price. the carrying value of our notes was $450.2 million as of january 31, 2010. this represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of january 31, 2010. the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31, 2010 was $545.2 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of our notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, which was $94.82. for further information, see note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. 53 table of contentsrisk factors 13 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software which is developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. if that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the united states and singapore. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located on the east coast of the united states. companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data or our information technology systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. these security 13 table of contents measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our appexchange directory, to access their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party appexchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party appexchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. in addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. we cannot accurately predict renewal rates, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts and for our small and medium size business customers. our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers ability to continue their operations and spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer. 14 table of contents if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. in addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are held to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both. the outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. any intellectual property claims and lawsuits could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan and require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our net income or cash flows (or both) or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; 15 table of contents the renewal rates for our service; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; the number of new employees added; changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of intense competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to developing our new global headquarters and increasing our data center capacity and expanding our data centers domestically and internationally; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; changes in the effective tax rates; general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; changes in deferred revenue balances due to the seasonal nature of our customer invoicing, changes in the average duration of our invoices, rate of renewals and the rate of new business growth; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. 16 table of contents additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may be affected by financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. as we acquire companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining quality standards consistent with our brand; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences. 17 table of contents in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our common stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. the market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general, and for crm in particular. many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. in addition, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise crm business applications and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: enterprise software application vendors; on-demand crm application service providers; 18 table of contents enterprise software application service providers; traditional platform development environment companies; and cloud computing development platform companies. many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the market for our force.com cloud computing platform is relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, and to expand into new geographic areas. 19 table of contents our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. periodic changes of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many 20 table of contents u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. if we fail to develop our brands, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. in the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. we may not realize the anticipated benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco where we plan to develop our global headquarters. if we do not realize these benefits, our financial performance will be negatively impacted. in november 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco, california, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, which we plan to develop into our global headquarters. we may not realize the anticipated benefits with respect to the purchase and future development of such real estate. we have devoted significant capital resources to the purchase, and we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future to building our global headquarters on such land, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms, or at all, or complete construction on schedule or within budget. any delay or lack of available financing could result in increased constructions costs and debt costs to fund such construction and development. in addition, our development efforts will otherwise be subject to various operational risks. we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations. the construction costs and total investment amounts may exceed any estimates that we formulate, and projects may not be completed, or delivered as planned. finally, real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. in the event that we have a future need to sell this property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31, 2011, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: 21 table of contents localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; regional economic conditions; and regional political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. from time to time, we may become defendants in legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment. we may become defendants in legal proceedings from time to time. companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability, as well as contract and employment-related claims. we may not be able to accurately assess the risk related to these suits, and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure. privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of the internet and other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for crm solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. 22 table of contents for example, in the united states regulations such as the gramm-leach-bliley act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. all of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. many other jurisdictions have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. we may lose key members of our management team and development and operations personnel, or may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles. increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. in addition, we are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. 23 table of contents natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to ownership of our common stock and our convertible senior notes due 2015 the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; the net increases in the number of customers, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due january 15, 2015 (the notes ); and any other factors discussed herein. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating 24 table of contents results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, delaware law and our outstanding notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. as a result of our sale of the notes in january 2010, we have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods. our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because: it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal in 2015 or earlier if necessary; and 25 table of contents it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. the trading price of the notes may be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock, which may be volatile, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality. because the notes are convertible into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes, and at our election, cash and/or shares of the company common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts, the market price of our common stock may significantly affect the trading price of the notes. see the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation above. in addition, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality may significantly affect the trading price of the notes. we also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall. during the term of the notes, interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. however, if interest rates increase, the option value of the notes convertibility feature will increase, but the yield of the notes will decrease, and if interest rates decrease, the option value of the notes convertibility feature will decrease, but the yield of the notes will increase. in addition, our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the notes and will be influenced by a number of factors, including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding. any decrease in our credit quality could negatively impact the trading price of the notes. the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the issuance of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. as the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions, their activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. in addition, the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, swiss franc, singapore dollar, japanese yen and australian dollar. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. in accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at january 31, 2011. this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2011 could result in a $27.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.1 million. market risk and market interest risk in january 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the notes ). holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes. amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. as of february 1, 2011 the notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder. for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the notes. accordingly, the notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april 30, 2011. upon conversion of any notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal 51 table of contents amount of the notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. therefore, as of february 1, 2011, the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible. the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes. however, the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price. the carrying value of our notes was $472.5 million as of january 31, 2011. this represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of january 31, 2011. the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31, 2011 was $946.1 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $164.55. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for the minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting. otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. at january 31, 2011, the fair value of these investments was $27.1 million. 52 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the united states. companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data or our it systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. these security 14 table of contents measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our it systems. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or it systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers on our appexchange directory to access their customer data. because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party appexchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party appexchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the market for our force.com cloud computing platform remains relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. 15 table of contents if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a datacenter contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. we cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation. this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted 16 table of contents by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. the european union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in deferred revenue balances and unbilled revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity; the number of new employees; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles; 17 table of contents general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; costs associated with acquisitions and subsequent integration of companies and technologies; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; any adverse resolution to income tax audits in any tax jurisdictions throughout the world; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; and the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise cloud computing applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: enterprise software application vendors; on-demand crm application service providers; traditional platform development environment companies; and cloud computing development platform companies. many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have 18 table of contents established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. as we acquire companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at private companies that we acquire; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. 19 table of contents if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with the overall growth of our company. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our 20 table of contents services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. for example, sales in europe and asia pacific together represented approximately 32 percent of our total revenues for the year ended january 31, 2012, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a small balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. 21 table of contents we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. in addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. the outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, a resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both. in addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. 22 table of contents we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of the internet, cross-border data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solution and adversely affect our business. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is occurring in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals in addition to laws and regulations that impact the cross-border transfer of personal information. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. if we fail to develop and maintain our brands, our business may suffer. we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expense to build our brands. brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. 23 table of contents in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. we may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco. if we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted. in november 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco, california, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. we may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate. we have devoted significant capital resources to the purchase, and if we develop the real estate will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. finally, real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. in the event that we cease development of the real estate in the future or have a future need to sell this property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to capitalization matters the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; the net increases in the number of customers, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; 24 table of contents announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and any other factors discussed herein. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 25 table of contents in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 57 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling and japanese yen. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. in accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at january 31, 2012. this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2012 could result in a $12.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $27.7 million. market risk and market interest risk in january 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the notes ). holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes. amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. for the three months ended january 31, 2012 the notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31, 2012, our common stock traded did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the notes. accordingly, the notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are not convertible. 57 table of contents the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes. however, the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price. the carrying value of our notes was $496.1 million as of january 31, 2012. this represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of january 31, 2012. the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31, 2012 was $869.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which was $151.25. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. as of january 31, 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these investments was $48.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. 58 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the united states. companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. 10 table of contents if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data or our it systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. these security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our it systems. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or it systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from oracle corporation and hardware from a variety of vendors. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the markets for our marketing cloud and salesforce platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be 11 table of contents successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. we cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic 12 table of contents conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity; the number of new employees; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in federal, state or international tax laws 13 table of contents and accounting principles, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, results of tax examinations by the internal revenue service, state and foreign taxing authorities, as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders equity; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; any adverse resolution to income tax audits in any tax jurisdictions throughout the world; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules; the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which is triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. we expect to incur net gaap losses in the future. we have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since july 31, 2011. in addition, we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our long-term benefit, such as equity awards and business combinations. additionally, for the foreseeable future, we must maintain a substantial valuation allowance against our deferred income tax asset balance. if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs, we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses, on a u.s. gaap basis, in the future. 14 table of contents the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: enterprise software application vendors; cloud computing application service providers; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; traditional platform development environment companies; and cloud computing development platform companies. many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. as we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; 15 table of contents the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with the overall growth of our company. we regularly upgrade and/or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train 16 table of contents and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. historically, sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented over 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; 17 table of contents pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values of these balances; regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. for example, we have received a notice from a large non-practicing entity alleging that we infringe upon certain of its patents. we continue to analyze the potential merits of such claim, if any, the potential defenses and counterclaims to such claim and we have been engaged in discussions with this entity with respect to these matters. no litigation has been filed to date. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. 18 table of contents any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both. in addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of the internet, cross-border data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solution and adversely affect our business. as internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely. for example, we believe increased regulation is occurring in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals in addition to laws and regulations that impact the cross-border transfer of personal information. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data 19 table of contents necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. if the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, crm solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce.com brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. we may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco. if we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted. in november 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco, california, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. we may not realize any benefits 20 table of contents with respect to the purchase of such real estate. during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity on the land. if we commence efforts to develop the real estate, we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. in the event that we decide to sell this property, the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. the european union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to capitalization matters the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; 21 table of contents disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; corporate actions, including our proposal to increase our authorized share capital to be voted upon by our stockholders in march 2013 and our related contingent stock split proposal; the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and any other factors discussed herein. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. 22 table of contents in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar and japanese yen. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. in accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion at january 31, 2013. this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2013 could result in a $16.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. 56 table of contents at january 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $12.1 million. market risk and market interest risk in january 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the notes ). holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes. amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. for the three months ended january 31, 2013 the notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. for 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended january 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the notes. accordingly, the notes will be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april 30, 2013 and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible. the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes. however, the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price. the carrying value of our notes was $521.3 million as of january 31, 2013. this represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of january 31, 2013. the total estimated fair value of our notes at january 31, 2013 was $1,178.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, which was $205.00. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. as of january 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of these investments in privately-held companies was $46.8 million and $48.3 million, respectively. 57 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. risks related to our business and industry defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when 10 table of contents index to financial statements first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. in addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the united states and other countries. any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers. our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. as part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the united states. companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer data or our data or our it systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. these security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our it systems. additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or it systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. any security breach 11 table of contents index to financial statements could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. as we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. in july 2013, we acquired exacttarget, our largest acquisition in the company history. acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; the difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology; potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and the tax effects of any such acquisitions. in addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. 12 table of contents index to financial statements privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business. regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. in some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union data protection directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the european union e-privacy directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business. our customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business. in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. 13 table of contents index to financial statements if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service. our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the attrition rates for our service; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity; the number of new employees; changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; 14 table of contents index to financial statements the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the united states and many countries in the european union, changes in accounting principles, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, results of tax examinations by the internal revenue service, state and foreign taxing authorities, as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation; changes to non-income taxes due to changes in federal, state or international tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions; changes in accounting principles; changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules; 15 table of contents index to financial statements the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which is triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. we derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. the markets for our salesforce1 exacttarget marketing cloud and salesforce1 platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. further, the introduction of new services beyond the crm market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. our efforts to expand our service beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. in addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. 16 table of contents index to financial statements we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. we cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. if our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. we compete primarily with vendors of packaged crm software and companies offering on-demand crm applications. we also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. our current competitors include: enterprise software application vendors; cloud computing application service providers; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; traditional platform development environment companies; and cloud computing development platform companies. many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. as a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. 17 table of contents index to financial statements if the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. we regularly upgrade and/or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. the additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for 18 table of contents index to financial statements delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. in the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international sales. we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. historically, sales in europe and asia pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data protection and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values of these balances; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; foreign currency fluctuations and controls; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and regional economic and political conditions. any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in u.s. dollars or local currency. as a result, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. 19 table of contents index to financial statements we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. for example, we received a notice from a large non-practicing entity alleging that we infringed upon certain of its patents. while no litigation was ever filed, in may 2013 we entered into a multi-year license agreement with the non-practicing entity that covered past period and future non-exclusive rights to its intellectual property. in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both. in addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. in addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have some u.s. patents and many u.s. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual 20 table of contents index to financial statements property rights are uncertain. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we also face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce.com brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. in the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. 21 table of contents index to financial statements we expect to incur net gaap losses in the future. we have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter except one since july 31, 2011. in addition, we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our long-term benefit, such as equity awards and business combinations. if our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs, we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses, on a u.s. gaap basis, in the future. our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. we have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods, including our outstanding $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% senior notes due january 15, 2015, $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% senior notes due april 1, 2018, $300.0 million term loan maturing in july 2016 with bank of america, n.a. and certain other lenders and capital lease arrangements in excess of $500.0 million. our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because: it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal beginning in 2015 or earlier if necessary; it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and limitations within the term loan covenants may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and the term loan. any required repayment of our notes and/or term loan as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. we may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in san francisco. if we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted. in november 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco, california, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. we may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate. during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity on the land. if we commence efforts to develop the real estate, we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. in the event that we decide to sell this property, the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. 22 table of contents index to financial statements weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. the european union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. these conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. risks relating to our convertible senior notes and our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our notes and underlying common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our notes and underlying common stock include: variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; recruitment or departure of key personnel; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; 23 table of contents index to financial statements the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; issuance of debt or other convertible securities; and any other factors discussed herein. in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and underlying common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our notes and underlying common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources. we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. in addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, the anticipated conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. in addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. in addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. in addition, if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. if the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. our inability to pay for your notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in your receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes. the fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. the fundamental change purchase rights, will allow holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. 24 table of contents index to financial statements the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. if, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. the effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. in addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. if one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things: permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; 25 table of contents index to financial statements authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill ); eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. in addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 59 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar and japanese yen. we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. in accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. interest rate sensitivity we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion at january 31, 2014. this amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least triple bbb or better. the cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at january 31, 2014 could result in a $8.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. at january 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion. the fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $16.7 million. market risk and market interest risk in january 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the 0.75% senior notes ) and in march 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% senior notes ) (collectively the notes ). holders may convert the notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the notes. amounts in excess of the principal amounts of the notes, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes. the 0.75% senior notes and the 0.25% senior notes have fixed annual interest rates of 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes. however, the value of 59 table of contents index to financial statements the notes are exposed to interest rate risk. generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. in addition, the fair values of our notes is affected by our stock price. the carrying value of our 0.75% senior notes was $542.2 million and the carrying value of our 0.25% senior notes was $1.0 billion as of january 31, 2014, which represents the liability components of the $568.9 million principal balance and $1.15 billion principal balance, respectively. the total estimated fair values of our 0.75% senior notes and 0.25% senior notes at january 31, 2014 were $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% senior notes and 0.25% senior notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which were $283.78 and $115.29, respectively. in july 2013, we entered into a $300.0 million term loan (the term loan ) which matures in july 2016 and bears interest at our option of either a base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.00% or an adjusted libor rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.00%. the company entered into the term loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of exacttarget. interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest as described above at the end of an interest period. the term loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning in september 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity. by entering into the term loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or libor. the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. when our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. as of january 31, 2014 and january 31, 2013 the fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $77.0 million and $46.8 million, respectively. 60 table of contents
