risk factors 13 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, optical and specialty materials and glass products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, generally comprise between 70-to-80% of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg's single largest production cost component. ppg input prices inflated further in the first half of 2012 continuing the trend of 2010 and 2011, and then, in the second half of the year, moderated modestly from the year's peak levels. the largest inflationary impact related to the cost of titanium dioxide pigments, with year-over-year reductions in the costs for various petrochemical-based materials countering those increases. raw material costs for our coatings businesses increased nearly $725 million due to inflation during the three year period ended december 31, 2012. the inflation rate for 2012 was low single-digit percentages. we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins are at risk of being lowered. most of the raw materials used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs. these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy, qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world, and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg's supply of titanium dioxide and other materials. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2010, the global economy began to mend from the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009; however, the pace of recovery was uneven. beginning in 2011, overall activity levels in most major global economies and in most end-use markets exhibited year-over-year growth. during 2012, overall activity levels varied greatly among the major global economies, with similar differences experienced among the various coatings end-use markets. because of this variation, overall aggregate ppg global volume grew modestly for the year, with some deviation from quarter-to-quarter. entering 2012 ppg annual report and form 10-k 13 table of contents 2013, the disparity of economic activity by region and end use market is anticipated to continue. of the major regions, growth prospects remain in north america, bolstered by further anticipated recovery in construction activity and continued strength in various industrial markets, including automotive production and increased investment related to the energy and chemical industries. however, concerns over fiscal uncertainty and unemployment temper these prospects somewhat. the 2013 growth rate in emerging regions is expected to remain mixed, but improve somewhat based on increases in local consumption, less inventory destocking associated with lower exports, and government stimulus actions. the eurozone is expected to remain subdued with very few end-use markets expected to deliver growth, and downside risk to regional economic conditions remains. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets and in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any significant or rapid decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced earnings and cash flows. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to, including those in the united states as well as in other countries in which we operate, impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. we have accrued a $332 million liability for estimated environmental remediation costs at december 31, 2012 . our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $275 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the settlement described in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k does not become effective, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them. new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could 14 2012 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents potentially impact (i) the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or (ii) our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in non-u.s. operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our expansion outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2012 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 57% . fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results. as a producer of coatings and specialty materials, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature. we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. the separation of the commodity chemicals business on january 28, 2013, significantly reduces the volumes of these materials that we handle and transport. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses. in the past 15 years, ppg has completed over 50 acquisitions to further the growth of the company, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future as part of our growth strategy. of particular note, ppg agreed in december 2012 to purchase the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel n.v. upon closing, this acquisition will add approximately 600 stores and eight manufacturing facilities to ppg's north american coatings operations. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices 30 2012 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents and to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 11, derivative financial instruments and hedge activities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2012 and 2011 were used to hedge ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 were assets of $3 million and liabilities of $1 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg's earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011 would have been $14 million and $23 million, respectively. as of january 1, 2012, ppg had nine u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.16 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on march 15, 2013 and $560 million were to settle on march 15, 2018. in june 2012, $600 million of the swaps, with a settlement date of march 15, 2013, were settled with ppg receiving $1 million in cash. on settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts, ppg will receive $560 million u.s. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. during the term of these contracts, ppg will receive semiannual payments in march and september of each year based on u.s. dollar, long-term fixed interest rates, and ppg will make annual payments in march of each year to the counterparties based on euro, long-term fixed interest rates. the company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and, as a result, the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) ("aoci"), and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. as of december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011, the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $95 million and $120 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $84 million and $153 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $449 million as of december 31, 2012 and $441 million as of december 31, 2011. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $51 million and $50 million as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. at december 31, 2011, the notional value of interest rate swaps converted $445 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. during 2012, ppg settled these swaps, receiving $29 million from such settlements. the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $26 million, as of december 31, 2011. the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $1 million as of december 31, 2011, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg's variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $0.1 million and $1 million for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $81 million and $90 million as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual earnings or cash flows. the company entered into forward starting swaps in 2009 and in the second quarter of 2010 to effectively lock-in a fixed interest rate for future debt refinancings with an anticipated term of ten years based on the ten year swap rate, to which was added a corporate spread. the notional amount of these swaps was $400 million. all of the swap contracts were settled on july 30, 2012, resulting in a cash payment of $121 million. as of december 31, 2011, the fair value of these swaps was a liability of $92 million. a 10% decline in interest rates would have unfavorably affected the fair value of these swaps by $9 million as of december 31, 2011. the company used derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuating natural gas prices through the use of natural gas swap contracts. there were no natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2012 as the price of natural gas declined for the past four years and is not expected to be as volatile over the next 12 to 18 months as continued development of shale oil and gas reserves is expected to maintain downward pressure on the price of natural gas. as of december 31, 2011, the fair value of the contracts was a liability of $9 million. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts by increasing the liability by $2 million at december 31, 2011. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company's exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 11 derivative financial instruments and hedge activities and note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 was an asset of $130 million and $56 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg's stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $19 million and $12 million at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 2012 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, optical and specialty materials and glass products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, generally comprise between 70% and 80% of cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg's single largest production cost component. we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins are at risk of being lowered. most of the raw materials used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations. our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2012 and 2013, overall economic trends remained mixed among the major global economies, with major coatings end-use markets also experiencing similar variations. given these economic conditions, overall aggregate ppg global sales volume for 2013 was flat with the prior year. entering 2014, we expect modest global growth. we anticipate growth will be the broadest in the u.s. economy, spanning across several coatings end-use markets as favorable market conditions continue in automotive oem, architectural coatings and aerospace. we expect emerging regions growth to remain mixed, but we expect ppg to post solid growth based on the end-markets the company supplies. in europe, economies appear to be improving but remain fragile. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets and in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any significant or rapid decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash flows. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to, including those in the u.s. as well as in other countries in which we operate, impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims 14 2013 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the settlement described in note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k does not become effective, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them. new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact (i) the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or (ii) our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our expansion outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2013 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 59%. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; 2013 ppg annual report and form 10-k 15 table of contents difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only impair our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to 30 2013 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 10, derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2013 and 2012 were used to hedge ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 were insignificant. the potential reduction in ppg's income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 would have been $9 million and $14 million, respectively. in 2008, ppg entered into u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.16 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on march 15, 2013 and $560 million were to settle on march 15, 2018. in june 2012, $600 million of the swaps, with a settlement date of march 15, 2013, were settled with ppg receiving $1 million in cash. on settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts, ppg will receive $560 million u.s. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. during the term of these contracts, ppg will receive semiannual payments in march and september of each year based on u.s. dollar, long-term fixed interest rates, and ppg will make annual payments in march of each year to the counterparties based on euro, long-term fixed interest rates. the company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in acquired european coatings businesses and, as a result, the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) ("aoci"), and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. as of december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012, the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $120 million and $95 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $81 million and $84 million at december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $453 million as of december 31, 2013 and $449 million as of december 31, 2012. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $53 million and $51 million as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. at december 31, 2011, interest rate swaps with a notional value of $445 million converted fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. during 2012, ppg settled these swaps, receiving $29 million from such settlements. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg's variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $81 million as of december 31, 2013 and 2012; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income from continuing operations or cash flows. equity price risk an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company's exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 10 derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 was an asset of $207 million and $130 million, respectively (see note 9 fair value measurements ). a 10% decrease in ppg's stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $26 million and $19 million at december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 2013 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, specialty materials and glass products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, generally comprise between 70% and 80% of cost of goods, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg's single largest production cost component. while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower. most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations. our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2014, overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies. demand was also varied by major coatings end-use markets, however, we realized global growth in nearly all end-use categories. we anticipate growth will remain the strongest in the u.s. and canadian economies, including a further strengthening of growth that started in 2014 in non-residential construction. we also expect increased global demand in the automotive oem and aerospace industries. emerging regions growth is expected to remain mixed, but we expect ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the specific end use-markets we supply. our base case assumption is that european growth will remain mixed by country but subdued overall, but european economies may benefit from lower global energy prices. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash flows. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $75 million to $200 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, antitrust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and 14 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the settlement described in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k does not become effective, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results expressed in u.s. dollars. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them. new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our expansion outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2014 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 59% . business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k 15 table of contents difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2014 and 2013 were used to hedge ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was insignificant. the potential reduction in ppg's income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 would have been $24 million and $9 million, respectively. as of january 1, 2012, ppg had u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.16 billion outstanding, of which $600 million were settled in june 2012. the remaining outstanding contracts of $560 million are expected to be settled in march 2018. on settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts, ppg will receive $560 million u.s. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. during the term of these contracts, ppg receives semiannual payments in march and september of each year based on u.s. dollar, long-term fixed interest rates, and ppg makes annual payments in march of each year to the counterparties based on euro, long-term fixed interest rates. the company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in acquired european coatings businesses and, as a result, the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income ("aoci"), and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $32 million and $120 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $70 million and $81 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $1,325 million as of december 31, 2014 and $453 million as of december 31, 2013. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $154 million and $53 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. during 2012, ppg settled interest rate swaps with a notional value of $445 million that converted fixed rate debt to variable rate debt, receiving $29 million from such settlements. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $62 million as of december 31, 2014 and $81 million as of december 31, 2013; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income from continuing operations or cash flows. equity price risk an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company's exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was an asset of $268 million and $207 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg's stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $32 million and $26 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31 table of contentsrisk factors 13 risk factors as a global

certain economic conditions in 2016. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting

environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $75 million to $200 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the settlement described in

income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results expressed in u.s. dollars. in 2015, this strengthening had an unfavorable impact on full year net sales and income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into u.s. dollars of approximately $1.1 billion and $120 million, respectively. for many years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and the satisfaction of 14 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k certain closing conditions. we are working with the court and the parties to finalize the arrangement in the first half of the 2016. if the arrangement is not finalized, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation

significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2015 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 58% . changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. recent developments, including the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k 15 our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2015 and 2014 were generally designated as a hedge of ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of these contracts was immaterial. the potential reduction in ppg's income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european and canadian currencies and 20% for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 would have been $29 million and $24 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , ppg had u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $41 million and a net liability of $32 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of this instrument by $60 million as of december 31, 2015 and increasing the liability by $70 million at december 31, 2014 . as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $242 million and $154 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $75 million and $62 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income from continuing operations or cash flows. equity price risk an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company's exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to an asbestos settlement trust (see note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of these instruments as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 was an asset of $223 million and $268 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg's stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these instruments of $27 million and $32 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 2015 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31risk factors 13 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, specialty materials and fiber glass products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 70% and 80% of the company's cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg's single largest production cost component. while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower. most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2016, overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities. refer to item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10-k for discussion of the economic conditions in 2016 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2017. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the 2016 ppg annual report and form 10-k 13 handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including those described in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in u.s. dollars. in 2016, this u.s. dollar strengthening had an unfavorable impact on full year net sales and income before income taxes from the translation of foreign earnings into u.s. dollars of approximately $400 million and $70 million, respectively. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them. new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2016 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 60% . changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future 14 2016 ppg annual report and form 10-k effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. recent developments, including potential u.s. tax reform discussions, the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive oem new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings. our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. 2016 ppg annual report and form 10-k 15 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in

and increasing the liability by $60 million at december 31, 2015 . as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $3.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $344 million and $242 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an

increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $65 million and $75 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income from continuing operations or cash flows. equity price risk in prior years, ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company's exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust (see note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). in june 2016, ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled. at settlement, the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million . as of december 31, 2015, the aggregated fair value of these instruments was an asset of $223 million. a 10% decrease in ppg's stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these instruments of $27 million as of december 31, 2015 . 2016 ppg annual report and form 10-k 33risk factors 15 risk factors as a

of which is substantial. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome

net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in u.s. dollars. in 2017, changes in the u.s. dollar versus our mix of currencies had a favorable impact on full year net sales and an unfavorable impact on income before income taxes from the translation of foreign earnings into u.s. dollars of approximately $55 million and $7 million, respectively. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of

economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2017 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 62% . changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. in december 2017, the u.s. enacted the u.s. tax cuts and job act. while the company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation's impact on ppg, u.s. regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over the next year which could alter the company's conclusions regarding the impact of the new law. further, ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. recent developments, including the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions. over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. 2017 ppg annual report and form 10-k 17 our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive oem new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings. our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2017 and 2016 were generally designated as a hedge of ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $19 million and a net asset of $16 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg's income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european and canadian currencies and 20% for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 would have been $255 million and $105 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , ppg had u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $2 million and $65 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $58 million and by $54 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $314 million and $344 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $61 million and $65 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income from continuing operations or cash flows. equity price risk in prior years, ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company's exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust (see note 9, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). in june 2016, ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled. at settlement, the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million. 2017 ppg annual report and form 10-k 39risk factors 12 risk factors as a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 70% and 80% of the company's cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg's single largest production cost component. while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower. most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. refer to item 1. raw materials and energy of this form 10-k/a for a discussion of the current year trends and outlook in raw material and energy costs. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities. refer to item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10-k/a for discussion of the economic conditions in 2017 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2018. 12 2017 ppg annual report and 10-k/a we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k/a, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including those described in note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k/a, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in u.s. dollars. in 2017, changes in the u.s. dollar versus our mix of currencies had a favorable impact on full year net sales and an unfavorable impact on income before income taxes from the translation of foreign earnings into u.s. dollars of approximately $55 million and $7 million, respectively. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them. new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. 2017 ppg annual report and form 10-k/a 13 our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2017 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 62% . changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. in december 2017, the u.s. enacted the u.s. tax cuts and job act. while the company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation's impact on ppg, u.s. regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over the next year which could alter the company's conclusions regarding the impact of the new law. further, ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. recent developments, including the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions. over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. 14 2017 ppg annual report and 10-k/a our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction

highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. we have concluded that certain of our previously issued financial statements should not be relied upon and have restated certain of our previously issued financial statements, which may lead to, among other things, shareholder litigation, loss of investor confidence, negative impact on our stock price and certain other risks. as discussed in the explanatory note, note 2, restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements and in note 19, quarterly financial information (unaudited) under item 8 of this form 10-k/a, we have concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2017, and the final quarterly and year-to-date period in 2016, should no longer be relied upon. the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that certain financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements. as a result of these misstatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, shareholder litigation and government investigations. any such proceeding could result in substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation or investigation. if we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. we are remediating certain internal controls and procedures, which, if not successful, could result in additional misstatements in our financial statements negatively affecting our results of operations. we are in the process of implementing certain remediation actions. see item 9a. controls and procedures of this form 10-k/a for a description of these remediation measures. to the extent these steps are not successful, not sufficient to correct our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or are not completed in a timely manner, future financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. any of these matters could adversely affect our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and stock price and limit our ability to access the capital markets through equity or debt issuances. we are involved in governmental investigations, which are costly to conduct and may result in substantial financial and other penalties, as well as adverse effects on our business and financial condition. prior to filing the current report on form 8-k disclosing our receipt of the internal report on april 19, 2018, we self-reported these issues to the sec. we are cooperating with the sec in its investigation of this matter. the sec investigation is 2017 ppg annual report and form 10-k/a 15 continuing, and we are currently unable to predict its duration, scope or results or whether the sec will commence any legal action. if we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal statutes, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties, modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance. the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations and financial condition . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 10, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements, under item 8 of this form 10-k/a. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2017 and 2016 were generally designated as a hedge of ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $19 million and a net asset of $16 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg's income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european and canadian currencies and 20% for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 would have been $255 million and $105 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , ppg had u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $2 million and $65 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $58 million and by $54 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $314 million and $344 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $61 million and $65 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income from continuing operations or cash flows. equity price risk in prior years, ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company's exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust (see note 10, financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements and note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k/a). in june 2016, ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled. at settlement, the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million. 2017 ppg annual report and form 10-k/a 41risk factors 21 risk factors as a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. coatings raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. these raw materials represent ppg's single largest production cost component. while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower. most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and

an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2018, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. recently, global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors, including slowing global growth, global stock and commodity market volatility, disruption in existing trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, the united kingdom's exit from the european union, weaker demand in china and increasing interest rates in the united states. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result 2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 21 in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including those described in note 14 , commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in u.s. dollars. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. further, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire. any non-compliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2018 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 62% . 22 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. further, ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. recent developments, including the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions. over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive oem new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts. 2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 23 our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. we have concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and have restated those previously issued financial statements, which has led to, among other things, shareholder litigation, investigations by the sec and the u.s. attorney's office and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees, and may result in certain other risks. as discussed in the explanatory note, note 2, restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements and in note 19, quarterly financial information (unaudited) under item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k/a, we have concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2017, and the final quarterly and year-to-date period in 2016, should no longer be relied upon. the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements. although the company has restated these financial statements and the material weakness in the company's internal control over financial reporting has been remediated, as a result of these misstatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, the outcome of our shareholder litigation and government investigations, potential loss of investor confidence, and a negative impact on our stock price. our shareholder litigation and the government investigations could result in substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation or investigation. if we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. we are involved in investigations by the sec and the u.s. attorney's office which are costly to conduct and may result in substantial financial and other penalties, as well as adverse effects on our business and financial condition. in connection with the audit committee's review of alleged violations of our accounting policies and procedures, we self-reported this matter to the sec. we are cooperating with the sec and the u.s. attorney's office in their investigations of this matter. these investigations are continuing, and we are currently unable to predict their duration, scope or results or whether the sec or u.s. attorney will commence any legal action. if we are found to have violated securities laws or other federal statutes, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties, modifications of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance. the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations and financial condition . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 10 , financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2018 and 2017 were generally designated as a hedge of ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $36 million and a net liability of $19 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg's income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european and canadian currencies and 20% for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 would have been $291 million and $255 million, respectively. in february 2018, ppg entered into u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $575 million outstanding, which had a fair value of a net asset of $35 million as of december 31, 2018 . as of december 31, 2017, ppg had u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding, which had a fair value of a net asset of $2 million . a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $57 million and $58 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $299 million and $314 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. in the first quarter of 2018, ppg entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $8 million as of december 31, 2018 . an increase in variable interest rates of 10% would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest expense by $10 million over the term of the instrument. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and interest 44 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k expense for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $84 million and $61 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income before income taxes or cash flows. equity price risk in prior years, ppg entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the company's exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock to the trust (see note 10 , financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements and note 14 , commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k). in june 2016, ppg satisfied its funding obligation to the trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled. at settlement, the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million . 2018 ppg annual report and form 10-k 45risk factors 12 risk factors as a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 12 2019 ppg annual report and 10-k increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. these raw materials represent ppg's single largest production cost component. while not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower. most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. these initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. our raw materials include bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. demand for our products and services depends, in part, on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. recently, global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors, including slowing global growth, consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility, disruption in existing trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, the united kingdom's exit from the european union and weaker demand in china. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. in addition, various laws regulate health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg's current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including those described in note 14 , commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. 2019 ppg annual report and form 10-k 13 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in u.s. dollars. we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. further, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire. any non-compliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in global operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our operations outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2019 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 61% . changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. as a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. further, ppg may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available. recent developments, including the european commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the organisation for economic co-operation and development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. if our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations. 14 2019 ppg annual report and 10-k business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, significant public health issues, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. part of the company's strategy is growth through acquisitions. over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management's time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability, or existing cyber vulnerability; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business' standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition. our ability to understand our customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results. our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. in addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive oem new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive oem coatings and related automotive parts. our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. if we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. with each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. additionally, our ability to achieve price increases may impact the overall economics for the products we offer. competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations. the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate. increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. despite our efforts 2019 ppg annual report and form 10-k 15 to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. this could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. in 2018, we concluded that previously issued financial statements as detailed below should not be relied upon and restated those previously issued financial statements, which led to, among other things, shareholder litigation, investigations by the sec and the u.s. attorney's office, a settlement by the company with the sec and unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees, and which may result in certain other risks. as discussed in the explanatory note, note 2, restatement of previously reported consolidated annual financial statements and in note 19, quarterly financial information (unaudited) under item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k/a, in 2018 we concluded that our previously issued financial statements as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods in 2017, and the final quarterly and year-to-date period in 2016, should no longer be relied upon. the determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that these financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of misstatements. although the company restated these financial statements, remediated the material weakness in the company's internal control over financial reporting, reached a settlement with the sec and is no longer the subject of an investigation by the u.s. attorney's office, we continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties relating to these events, including shareholder derivative litigation, advancement of legal expenses and potential indemnification obligations to certain current and former employees who are responding to investigations by the sec and

changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in ppg's stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company's risk management policies are provided in note 10 , financial instruments, hedging activities and fair value measurements under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg's exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world. our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2019 and 2018 were designated as a hedge of ppg's exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $7 million and a net asset of $36 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg's income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european and canadian currencies and 20% for asian and latin american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 would have been $357 million and $291 million, respectively. in august 2019 and february 2018, ppg entered into u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts for $300 million and $575 million, respectively; with a combined notional amount of $875 million outstanding, resulting in a net asset with a fair value of $48 million and $35 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $87 million and $57 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $255 million and $299 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risk of fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. in the first quarter of 2018, ppg entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $35 million and $8 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. an increase in variable interest rates of 10% would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest 32 2019 ppg annual report and 10-k expense by $7 million and $10 million for the periods ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have an insignificant effect on ppg's variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the periods ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company's fixed rate debt by approximately $67 million and $84 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg's annual income before income taxes or cash flows.

to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and natural gas prices arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce this market risk. a detailed description of these exposures and the company risk management policies are provided in note 9, derivative financial instruments, under item 8 of this form 10-k. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk. the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $1 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from adverse changes in the exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies would have totaled approximately $1 million and $4 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar-denominated debt of $317 million and $409 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $46 million and $59 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk and, as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $23 million and a liability of $20 million, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $7 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and increased by $11 million as of dec. 31, 2001, if variable interest rates changed unfavorably by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $3 million and $6 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $53 million and $62 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. such changes would not have had a material effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the fair value of natural gas swap and option contracts was an asset of $24 million and a liability of $12 million as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to rising prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap and option contracts outstanding as of dec. 31, 2002 and 2001 of approximately $8 million and $12 million, respectively. in november 2002, an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 9, derivative financial instruments and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of dec. 31, 2002 was an asset of $1 million. a 10% unfavorable change in ppg stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument to a liability of $2 million. table of contents 26 ppg industries, inc. 2002 annual

market rates can impact ppg financial results, cash flows and financial condition. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2003 and 2002 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk. the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $0.2 million and $1 million as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from adverse changes in the exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies would have totaled approximately $0.2 million and $1 million as of dec.31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar-denominated debt of $28 million and $317 million as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the significant decrease in the debt levels is attributable to the company ongoing efforts to reduce overall debt levels, by deploying a portion of its operating cash flows for this purpose. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $7 million and $46 million as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk and, as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $9 million and $23 million, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $10 million and $7 million as of dec.31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $1 million and $3 million as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $40 million and $53 million as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. such changes would not have had a material effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the fair value of natural gas swap and option contracts was an asset of $3 million and $24 million as of dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to rising prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap and option contracts outstanding as of dec.31, 2003 and 2002 of approximately $3 million and $8 million, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 9, derivative financial instruments and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). in addition to the change in ppg stock price, contributing to the change in fair value of this instrument was the increase in the number of shares purchased by the bank from 504,900 shares as of dec. 31, 2002 to 904,900 shares as of dec. 31, 2003. the fair value of this instrument as of dec.

provided to reflect how reasonable, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg financial results, cash flows and financial condition. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2004 and 2003 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risk. the fair value of these contracts as of dec. 31, 2004 and 2003 was not material. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies would also not have been material. ppg had non-u.s. dollar-denominated debt of $44 million and $28 million outstanding as of dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of

table of contents financial and operating reviewrisk factors 14 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks that are not unlike the risks we have faced in years past. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to fully offset the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs through price increases or productivity improvements. growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world, including asia, eastern europe and south america, where energy and labor costs are lower than the u.s. could reduce demand for our products. our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. remediation at certain facilities is an ongoing operating cost, as pretax charges against income over the last 15 years for environmental remediation have ranged between $10 million and $49 million annually. we have accrued $94 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at dec. 31, 2005. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation could have an adverse impact on our operating results. for over thirty years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos-containing thermal insulation products manufactured by a 50% owned joint venture, pittsburgh corning corporation. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court approval and if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we sell products to u.s. automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers. further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers to have liquidity problems, potentially resulting in the write-off of amounts due from these customers. because we are a global company, our results are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. while approximately 90% of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states, canada and western europe, our remaining 14 | 2005 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents sales and operating income are generated in developing regions, such as asia, eastern europe and south america. certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings segment and sand, soda ash and polyvinyl butyral in the glass segment. the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. however, an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. as a producer of industrial chemicals and coatings, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. quantitative and

quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg financial results, cash flows and financial condition. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2005 and 2004 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004 was not material. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies would also not have been material. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt of $433 million as of dec. 31, 2005 and $44 million as of dec. 31, 2004. the increase in these borrowings was primarily due to the issuance of 300 million of notes in june 2005. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $50 million and $11 million as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk. the fair value of the interest rate swaps in place as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, was a liability of $7 million and an asset of $4 million, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $ 3 million and $9 million as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $2 million as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 53 million and $36 million as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the fair value of natural gas contracts in place as of dec. 31, 2005 was an asset of $0.3 million. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of dec. 31, 2004 was a liability of $ 2 million. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to rising prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004 of approximately $ 3 million and $1 million, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 9, derivative financial instruments and note 13, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004 was an asset of $ 10 million and $19 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $5 million and $6 million, respectively, as of dec. 31, 2005 and 2004. 27 | 2005 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents financial and operating reviewrisk factors 15 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position, and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses. each one-dollar change in the unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. all time record high natural gas costs in north america were reached in 2005 following the severe hurricanes that impacted the u.s. gulf coast in the third quarter. in 2006, natural gas costs in north america remained high by historical standards, but did decline slightly versus the 2005 levels. year-over-year coatings raw material costs rose by $75 million in 2006 following a rise of $245 million in 2005. additionally, certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the industrial coatings and performance and applied coatings businesses and sand, soda ash and polyvinyl butyral in the glass businesses. the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. however, an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. we experience substantial competition from certain low-cost regions growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world, including asia, eastern europe and latin america, where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the u.s., could result in lower selling prices or reduce demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products. our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations pretax charges against income for environmental remediation ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year over the 15 years prior to 2006. in 2006 those charges totaled $207 million. we have accrued $282 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at dec. 31, 2006. in addition to the amounts currently reserved, the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. for over thirty years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by a 50% owned joint venture, pittsburgh corning corporation. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we sell products to u.s.-based automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change, including the loss of u.s. market share by general motors, ford and daimler- chrysler. further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers and suppliers to have liquidity problems, potentially resulting in the write-off of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results because we are a global company, our results are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. while approximately 85% of sales and operating income is generated by products sold in the united states, canada and western europe, our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions, such as asia, eastern europe and latin america. 2006 ppg annual report and form 10-k 15 table of contents as a

in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $2 million as of dec. 31, 2006 and 2005. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 51 million and $53 million as of dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the fair value of natural gas contracts in place as of dec. 31, 2006 was a liability of $25 million. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of dec. 31, 2005 was an asset of $0.3 million. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to higher prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 of approximately $ 23 million and $3 million, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 10 and note 14, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of dec. 31, 2006 and 2005 was an asset of $ 14 million and $10 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $6 million and $5 million, respectively, as of dec. 31, 2006 and 2005. 2006 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31 table of contentsrisk factors 16 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses. each one-dollar change in our unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. in 2007, natural gas costs declined slightly in the u.s. compared to 2006 levels. year-over-year coatings raw material costs rose by $40 million in 2007 following a rise of $75 million in 2006. additionally, certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses; lenses, photochromic dye, sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses; brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business; and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses. we have made, and plan to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. however, an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. we experience substantial competition from certain low-cost regions growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world, including asia, eastern europe and latin america, where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the u.s., could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment excluding 2006, pretax charges against income for environmental remediation ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year over the past 15 years. in 2006 those charges totaled $207 million. we have accrued $276 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at december 31, 2007. our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome 16 2007 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. we sell products to u.s.-based automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change, including the loss of u.s. market share by general motors, ford and chrysler. further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers and suppliers to have liquidity problems, potentially resulting in the write-off of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results because we are a global company, our results are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. while approximately 80% of sales and operating income in 2007 was generated by products sold in the united states, canada and western europe, our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions, such as asia, eastern europe and latin america. with the acquisition of sigmakalon in january 2008, we have increased our international operations as substantially all of its sales are outside the united states. as a producer of chemicals, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. in addition, evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires, or war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and to deliver products to customers. the failure to successfully integrate the acquisition of sigmakalon could adversely affect our financial results on january 2, 2008, we completed the acquisition of sigmakalon, a worldwide coatings producer based in uithoorn, netherlands. the total cost of the transaction, including assumed debt, was approximately $3.2 billion. in the event that we do not successfully integrate sigmakalon into our operations, our consolidated operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. our performance is affected by the economic conditions in the u.s. and in other nations where we do business declining economic conditions may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. overall demand for our products could be reduced as a direct result of an economic recession. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company risk management policies are provided in note 11, derivative financial instruments and hedge activities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2007 and 2006 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2007 and 2006 were assets of $0.4 million and $2 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2007 and 2006 would have been $0.3 million and $2 million, respectively. in december 2007, ppg borrowed 717 million under the 1 billion bridge loan agreement established in december 2007 to finance a portion of the anticipated acquisition of sigmakalon. the euro proceeds were converted to $1,056 million and deposited into escrow until the closing of the transaction on january 2, 2008. on the same day the $1,056 million was placed into escrow, the company entered into a foreign currency forward contract to convert the u.s. dollars back to 717 million. a 10% decline in the value of the euro would have resulted in a decline in the fair value of this forward contract by $106 million, which would have been substantially offset by a gain on the 717 million loan. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt of $1,636 million as of december 31, 2007 and $472 million as of december 31, 2006. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $203 million and $63 million as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $6 million as of december 31, 2007 and a liability of $7 million as of december 31, 2006. the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $ 8 million and $2 million as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately $10 million as of december 31, 2007 and $2 million as of december 31, 2006. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 48 million and $51 million as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31, 2007 and 2006 was a liability of $8 million and $25 million, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to higher prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would result in a loss in the fair value of the underlying natural gas swap contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2007 and 2006 of approximately $ 26 million and $23 million, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 11 derivative financial instruments and hedge activities and note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2007 and 2006 was an asset of $ 18 million and $14 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg stock price would have reduced the value of this instrument by $6 million as of december 31, 2007 and 2006. 2007 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. the current u.s. and worldwide recession and credit crisis could have a continuing negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during the fourth quarter of 2008, the demand for many of our products in europe, asia and latin america declined significantly as the impact of the recession in the u.s. economy, which had impacted demand throughout 2008, spread globally. the impact of the recession was felt most noticeably by our businesses serving the automotive original equipment, construction and general industrial markets. entering 2009, the global economic outlook in terms of gdp and industrial production is for weak conditions to prevail. many economists are forecasting that the recession will persist through at least the first half of 2009. continued weakness in the global economy would be expected to result in lower demand for many of our products and increase our exposure to credit risk from customers in the industries most impacted by the weak economy. how deep and how long the recession will last is not known. we sell products to global and regional automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers. global production of automobiles and light trucks declined by 2% in 2008 reflecting declines of 19% in the u.s. and canada and 7% in western europe that were substantially offset by growth in production in eastern europe, asia and latin america. the industry forecast for 2009 projects a global decline of nearly 10%, with declines in production in all regions of the world led by the u.s. and canada, where vehicle production is forecast to be down approximately 25%. declines in the global production of automobiles and light trucks of this magnitude would adversely impact our sales volume. the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change, including the loss of u.s. market share by general motors, ford and chrysler. further deterioration of market conditions could cause certain of our customers and suppliers to experience liquidity problems, potentially resulting in the write-off of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers. our worldwide sales to general motors, ford and chrysler are made under normal credit terms and we expect to collect substantially all of the approximately $45 million due from these customers at december 31, 2008 in the first quarter of 2009; however, we remain focused on the continual management of this credit risk. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses. each one-dollar change in our unit price of natural gas per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. in 2008, our natural gas costs were volatile and, on average increased almost 25% in the u.s. compared to 2007 levels. year-over-year coatings raw material costs rose by $150 million in 2008 following a rise of $40 million in 2007. this inflation, which was partially linked to increased oil prices, occurred in all regions of the world, with the most significant impact in the u.s. the impact was most significant in the automotive, industrial, architectural coatings americas and asia pacific and automotive refinish businesses. we also import raw materials, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, our margins are at risk of being lowered if those foreign currencies strengthen against the local currencies of our manufacturing facilities. additionally, certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses; lenses, photochromic dye, sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses; brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business; and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses. we have made, and plan to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. however, an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. 10 2008 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents we experience substantial competition from certain low-cost regions. growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world, including asia, eastern europe and latin america, where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the u.s., could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. excluding 2006, pretax charges against income for environmental remediation ranged between $10 million and $49 million per year over the past 15 years. in 2006 those charges totaled $207 million. we have accrued $299 million for estimated remediation costs that are probable at december 31, 2008. our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. our products are subject to existing and evolving regulations. regulations concerning the composition and use of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. because we are a global company, our results are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. while approximately 75% of sales and operating income in 2008 was generated by products sold in the united states, canada and western europe, our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions, such as asia, eastern europe and latin america. as a producer of chemicals, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature. we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. in addition, evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires, or war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and to deliver products to customers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company risk management policies are provided in note 11, derivative financial instruments and hedge activities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. 26 2008 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents management discussion and analysis the following disclosures summarize ppg exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2008 and 2007 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 were liabilities of $17 million and assets of $0.4 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2008 and 2007 would have been $27 million and $0.3 million, respectively. concurrent with the march 18, 2008 completion of the $1.55 billion public debt offering, ppg entered into ten u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on march 15, 2013 and $700 million were to settle on march 15, 2018. on march 18, 2008, ppg paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of $1.3 billion and received euros, which were used to repay most of the 1 billion bridge loan, which the company employed to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon. during the fourth quarter of 2008, ppg converted $1.16 billion of these contracts to $208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts. on settlement of the contracts, ppg will receive $1.3 billion u.s. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts of which $600 million will settle on march 15, 2013 and $700 million will settle on march 15, 2018. the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in sigmakalon and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. as of december 31, 2008, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $130 million. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $181 million at december 31, 2008. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $1,373 million as of december 31, 2008 and $1,636 million as of december 31, 2007. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $118 million and $203 million as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $3 million and $6 million as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have decreased by $ 0.5 million and $8 million as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $3 million as of december 31, 2008 and $10 million as of december 31, 2007. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 118 million and $48 million as of december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $85 million and $8 million, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to higher prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by $27 million and $26 million at december 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 11 derivative financial instruments and hedge activities and note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $6 million and an asset of $ 18 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument and increased the liability by $6 million at december 31, 2008 and reduced the asset by $6 million at december 31, 2007. 2008 ppg annual report and form 10-k 27 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, glass and chemicals products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. the global recession and credit crisis could continue to have negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during the fourth quarter of 2008, the demand for many of our products in europe, asia and latin america declined significantly as the impact of the recession, which had impacted demand throughout 2008 in the u.s. and u.k. economies, spread globally. many global industrial end-markets remained depressed for most of 2009. the impact of the recession was felt by all of our businesses but most noticeably by those businesses serving the automotive original equipment, construction, housing and general industrial markets. entering 2010, the global economic outlook reflects expectations of gradual year-over-year improvement in many industrial sectors, but the breadth and pace of the recovery is uncertain. anticipation is for growth to continue in most asian economies driven by these global demand improvements. modest recovery is expected to continue in the north american economy, with some offsets due to later economic cycle sectors such as commercial construction, which is projected to continue to decline. the recovery rate of the european economy is expected to lag both asia and north america. a source of concern is the anticipation that various government stimulus programs will gradually be removed without a consensus conviction that consumer spending in these countries will provide an offset to support the recovery. continued weakness in the global economy would be expected to result in lower demand for many of our products and increase our exposure to credit risk from customers in the industries most impacted by the weak economy. how strongly the rebound of the global economy takes hold or if the signs of recovery will last is not known. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses. each one-dollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. in 2009, our natural gas costs on average decreased almost 33% in the u.s. compared to 2008 levels. year-over-year coatings raw material costs declined by approximately $150 million in 2009 following a rise of approximately $150 million in 2008. this increase in costs, which was partially linked to increased oil prices, occurred in all regions of the world, with the most significant impact in the u.s. whether oil prices and our raw material costs will increase in 2010 is not known. we also import raw materials, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the 10 2009 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents currency of the supplier and, therefore, our margins are at risk of being lowered if those foreign currencies strengthen against the local currencies of our manufacturing facilities. additionally, certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. these include titanium dioxide and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses; lenses, photochromic dye, sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses; brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business; and sand and soda ash in the glass businesses. we have made, and plan to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. however, an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. we experience substantial competition from certain low-cost regions. growing competition from companies in certain regions of the world, including asia, eastern europe and latin america, where energy and labor costs are lower than those in the u.s., could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our glass and fiber glass products. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. we have accrued $287 million for estimated environmental remediation costs that are probable at december 31, 2009. our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $300 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning

particular period. our products are subject to existing and evolving regulations. regulations concerning the composition and use of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact (i) the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or (ii) our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. because we are a global company, our results are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. while approximately 75% of sales and operating income in 2009 was generated by products sold in the united states, canada and western europe, our remaining sales and operating income are generated in developing regions, such as asia, eastern europe and latin america. as a producer of chemicals, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature. we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. in addition, evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs. we sell products to global and regional automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers. the economic downturn caused declines in global production of automobiles and light trucks, which adversely impacted our sales volumes. while the automotive market experienced higher and more consistent production and sales levels in the second half of 2009, the overall market still remained at a very low activity level. the north american automotive industry continues to experience structural change, including the loss of u.s. market share by general motors and chrysler. during 2009, both companies emerged from bankruptcy with the assistance of equity infusions by the u.s. government. these developments have mitigated any potential credit exposure we may face. however, we remain focused on the continual management of automotive customer credit risk as further deterioration of market conditions could 2009 ppg annual report and form 10-k 11 table of contents cause additional liquidity problems, potentially resulting in the write-off of amounts due from these customers and cost impacts of changing suppliers. additionally, the same economic conditions that are impacting our continuing businesses that serve the automotive original equipment manufacturer ( oem ) market are affecting the divested automotive glass and services business, in which ppg maintains an approximate 40 percent interest. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the 26 2009 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents management discussion and analysis company risk management policies are provided in note 12, derivative financial instruments and hedge activities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2009 and 2008 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2009 and 2008 were liabilities of $3 million and $17 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2009 and 2008 would have been $17 million and $27 million, respectively. concurrent with the march 18, 2008 completion of the $1.55 billion public debt offering, ppg entered into ten u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on march 15, 2013 and $700 million were to settle on march 15, 2018. on march 18, 2008, ppg paid the counterparties to the contracts a total of $1.3 billion and received euros, which were used to repay most of the 1 billion bridge loan, which the company employed to finance the acquisition of sigmakalon. during the fourth quarter of 2008, ppg converted $1.16 billion of these contracts to $208 million of cash and replaced them with new cross currency swap contracts. on settlement of the contracts, ppg will receive $1.3 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $308 million and $130 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increase the liability by $182 million and $181 million at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $723 million as of december 31, 2009 and $1,373 million as of december 31, 2008. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $81 million and $118 million as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $10 million and $3 million as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $ 3 million and $0.5 million as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $1 million as of december 31, 2009 and $3 million as of december 31, 2008. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 91 million and $118 million as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the company entered into forward starting swaps in the third quarter of 2009 to effectively lock-in a fixed interest rate based on the 10-year swap rate, to which will be added a corporate spread, related to future debt refinancings. the notional amount of these swaps totaled $250 million. as of december 31, 2009, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $3 million. a 10% decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by $10 million. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31, 2009 and 2008 was a liability of $50 million and $85 million, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to higher prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by $14 million and $27 million at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 12 derivative financial instruments and hedge activities and note 16, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2009 and 2008 was an asset of $18 million and a liability of $6 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $8 million and $6 million at december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 2009 ppg annual report and form 10-k 27 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, chemicals and glass products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the financial performance of our commodity chemicals and glass businesses. each one-dollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. in 2010, our natural gas costs on average decreased almost 12% in the u.s. compared to 2009 levels. year-over-year coatings raw material costs increased approximately $210 million following a decline of approximately $150 million in 2009. this increase in costs, which was partially linked to increased oil prices later in 2010, was driven by stronger emerging region demand, supply disruptions and lack of increased supplier capacity. increases occurred in all regions of the world, with the most significant impact in north america and europe. we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins are at risk of being lowered. additionally, certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. these include titanium dioxide, solvents and epoxy and other resins in the coatings businesses; lenses, sand and soda ash in the optical and specialty materials businesses; brine and ethylene in the commodity chemicals business; and sand, clay and soda ash in the glass businesses. we have made, and plan to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. however, an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products and an increase in raw material and energy prices would increase our costs. the lingering effects of the global recession in certain end-use markets could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during the fourth quarter of 2008, the demand for many of our products in europe, asia and latin america declined significantly as the impact of the recession, which had impacted demand throughout 2008 in the u.s. and u.k. economies, spread globally. many global industrial end-markets remained depressed for most of 2009. the impact of the recession was felt by all of our businesses but most noticeably by those businesses serving the automotive original equipment, construction, residential and general industrial markets. during 2010, the global economy began to mend; however, the pace of recovery was uneven. emerging economies rapidly returned to prerecession levels 10 2010 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents while volume recovery in developed regions was more gradual. there was also a contrast in the various end-use markets with global industrial end-use markets demonstrating a rapid and consistent recovery while construction markets, particularly commercial and residential, in the developed regions and parts of eastern europe remained depressed. the outlook for 2011 reflects expectations for the economic recovery to strengthen and broaden. the growth rate in emerging regions is expected to moderate somewhat but still easily outpace developed regions. it is anticipated that the north american recovery will continue with higher industrial activity and modest improvement in construction markets. the recovery rate in europe is expected to once again lag that of asia, latin america and north america, as export growth moderates and further effects are realized from 2010 austerity measures put in place to ease concerns over european governmental debt loads. construction markets in western and eastern europe are forecasted to improve only slightly in 2011. it is anticipated that global industrial activity will grow, but at a slower rate than 2010 in many industries. remaining at the current low activity levels in the commercial and residential construction markets of the developed regions and eastern europe would continue to result in low demand for many of our products that serve these markets and keep credit risk exposure elevated from customers most impacted by these industries. the extent of or the sustainability of the recovery in the global economy or which end-use markets and developed regions will rebound in 2011 is not known. we experience substantial competition from certain low-cost regions. our flat glass and fiber glass businesses are subject to competition from companies in certain regions of the world, including asia, eastern europe and latin america, where labor costs are lower than those in the u.s. this could result in lower selling prices or reduced demand for some of our flat glass and fiber glass products. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. we have accrued $272 million for estimated environmental remediation costs that are probable at december 31, 2010. our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million which is a change from the previously reported range of $200 million to $300 million. this change in estimate relates principally to the cost of new jersey chrome and legacy glass manufacturing site remediation. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. the results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 16, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. our products are subject to existing and evolving regulations. regulations concerning the composition and use of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact (i) the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or (ii) our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in non-u.s. operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. as a result of our expansion outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in the international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our percentage of sales generated in 2010 by products sold in developing regions, including asia, eastern europe, the middle east, africa and latin america was 27%. as a producer of commodity chemicals, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature. we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. in addition, evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and 2010 ppg annual report and form 10-k 11 table of contents the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market

sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2010 and 2009 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2010 and 2009 were assets of $2 million and liabilities of $3 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for european currencies and 20% for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2010 and 2009 would have been $22 million and $17 million, respectively. concurrent with the march 18, 2008 completion of the $1.55 billion public debt offering, ppg entered into ten u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on march 15, 2013 and $700 million were to settle on march 15, 2018. on march 18, 2008, ppg paid the

notional amount of $140 million and a settlement date of march 15, 2018 was converted to cash during the first quarter of 2010. accordingly, on settlement of the contracts, ppg will receive $1.2 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $163 million and $308 million, respectively. a 10% increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $158 million and $182 million at december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $447 million as of december 31, 2010 and $723 million as of december 31, 2009. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10% against european currencies and by 20% against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $52 million and $81 million as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $20 million and $10 million as of 26 2010 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $ 1 million and $3 million as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10%. a 10% increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $1 million as of december 31, 2010 and december 31, 2009, respectively. further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 115 million and $91 million as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. the company entered into forward starting swaps in the third quarter of 2009 to effectively lock-in a fixed interest rate based on the 10-year swap rate, to which will be added a corporate spread, related to future debt refinancings. the notional amount of these swaps totaled $250 million. in the second quarter of 2010, the company entered into additional forward starting swaps arrangements with a notional amount of $150 million. as of december 31, 2010, the fair value of these swaps was a liability of $21 million. as of december 31, 2009, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of $3 million. a 10% decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by $14 million and $10 million as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31, 2010 and 2009 was a liability of $31 million and $50 million, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to higher prices of natural gas. a 10% reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts and increased the liability by $5 million and $14 million at december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 12 derivative financial instruments and hedge activities and note 16, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2010 and 2009 was an asset of $55 million and $18 million, respectively. a 10% decrease in ppg stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $12 million and $8 million at december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2010 ppg annual report and form 10-k 27 table of contentsrisk factors 11 risk factors as a global manufacturer of coatings, chemicals and glass products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. these risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and liquidity. while the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our business. increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results. our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. energy is a significant production cost in the commodity chemicals and glass segments, and our primary energy cost is natural gas. each one-dollar change in our unit cost of natural gas per million british thermal units has a direct impact of approximately $60 million to $70 million on our annual operating costs. inclusive of the impact of ppg natural gas hedging activities, ppg 2011 natural gas unit cost decreased 15 percent in the u.s. compared to 2010, reflecting higher natural gas supply stemming from the success of shale gas drilling. also, in our commodity chemicals segments, ethylene is a key raw material. during 2011, ppg costs for ethylene increased substantially compared to 2010 driven by a combination of tight supplies due to production outages and increased global demand, particularly in u.s. exports of ethylene derivative products. coatings raw materials both organic, primarily petroleum based, and inorganic, generally comprise between 70-to-80 percent of coatings cost of goods sold in most coatings formulations and represent ppg single largest production cost component. in 2011, overall coatings raw material costs inflated by approximately 10-to-12 percent for the company. the largest inflation impacts were from titanium dioxide pigments and certain propylene-based resins. during 2011, the incremental cost of coatings raw materials due to inflation was approximately $440 million. this compares to coatings raw material inflation of approximately $210 million in 2010 and a benefit of $150 million in 2009 from lower coatings raw material prices reflecting a drop in overall commodity prices due to the recession. we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. in most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins are at risk of being lowered. most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts, multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. the company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to support its continuous efforts to find the lowest raw material costs. these initiatives include reformulation of our products using both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy, qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from asia and other lower cost regions of the world, and strategic initiatives with multiple global suppliers to secure and enhance ppg supply of titanium dioxide and other materials. an inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner. the pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. during 2008, worldwide demand for many of our products declined significantly as the impact of the recession spread globally. many global industrial end-use markets remained depressed for most of 2009. during 2010, the global economy began to mend; however, the pace of recovery was uneven. beginning in 2011, overall activity levels in most major global economies and in most end-use markets exhibited year-over-year growth. the north american economy experienced early overall improving industrial and chemical activity, particularly solid improvement in automotive oem production. however, as the year progressed, factors such as unemployment rates, impasses on government policy and concerns over the global economy limited the rate of economic growth in this region. the european economy 2011 ppg annual report and form 10-k 11 table of contents underperformed most other major economies. economic activity in this region, which was growing slowly, began to fade, and demand in many end-use markets served by ppg turned negative late in the year. in many emerging economies, such as those in asia and latin america, economic activity surpassed the pre-recession pace due, in part, to continued industrial and infrastructure growth in these regions. however, inflation concerns and government fiscal policies in these regions dampened demand. entering 2012, our expectation is for the pace of economic activity to continue to vary by region and by end-use market. in north america, most major sectors of the economy are expected to strengthen as the recovery continues to gradually move the economy back to pre-recession levels. the european economy is expected to mildly contract in early 2012 despite growth in exported products, but there is downside risk the economic conditions in europe could be even weaker in 2012. the growth rate in emerging regions is expected to continue to moderate and be more erratic but still outpace that of the developed regions. based on our broad geographic footprint and extensive end-use market exposure, we expect to see overall higher demand in 2012 versus 2011, however, the extent of variations in the global economy and their impacts on various end-use markets that we serve is not known. ppg provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets and in many geographies. while this broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any significant or rapid decrease in activity levels, nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales which would result in reduced earnings and cash flows. we are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. the environmental laws and regulations we are subject to, including those in the united states as well as in other countries in which we operate, impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as described in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. we have accrued a $226 million liability for estimated environmental remediation costs at december 31, 2011. our assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $200 million to $400 million. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. we are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential in which substantial monetary damages are sought. those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, anti-trust and other matters arising out of the conduct of ppg current and past business activities. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management attention and resources. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. we believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the settlement described in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities under item 8 of this form 10-k does not become effective, will not have a material effect on ppg consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. for over 30 years, we have been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. most of our potential exposure relates to allegations by plaintiffs that ppg should be liable for injuries involving asbestos containing thermal insulation products manufactured by pittsburgh corning corporation ( pc ). ppg is a 50% shareholder of pc. although we have entered into a settlement arrangement with several parties concerning these asbestos claims as discussed in note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k, the arrangement remains subject to court proceedings and, if not approved, the outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period. 12 2011 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents we are subject to a variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs. we are subject to a wide variety of complex u.s. and non-u.s. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. these laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them. new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. for example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact (i) the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or (ii) our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains. our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. ppg has a significant investment in non-u.s. operations. this broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. as a result of our expansion outside the u.s., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. our percentage of sales generated in 2011 by products sold outside the u.s. was approximately 58%. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect our financial results. as a producer of commodity chemicals, we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature. we have significant experience in handling these materials and take precautions to handle and transport them in a safe manner. however, these materials, if mishandled or released into the environment, could cause substantial property damage or personal injuries resulting in significant legal claims against us. in addition, evolving regulations concerning the security of chemical production facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals could result in increased future capital or operating costs. business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of ppg, our customers and our suppliers. it is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. however, such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers. we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses. in the past 15 years, ppg has completed over 50 acquisitions to further the growth of the company, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future as part of our growth strategy. making acquisitions and forming joint ventures involve risks, including: difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products; diversion of our management time and attention from other business concerns; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures or product liability; 2011 ppg annual report and form 10-k 13 table of contents unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; and difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses. our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ppg is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in ppg stock price. the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. a detailed description of these exposures and the company risk management policies are provided in note 11, derivative financial instruments and hedge activities, under item 8 of this form 10-k. the following disclosures summarize ppg exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact ppg consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2011 and 2010 were used to hedge ppg exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. the fair value of these contracts as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 were liabilities of $1 million and assets of $2 million, respectively. the potential reduction in ppg earnings resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10 percent for european currencies and 20 percent for asian and south american currencies for the years ended december 31, 2011 and 2010 would have been $23 million and $22 million, respectively. ppg entered into nine u.s. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.16 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on march 15, 2013 and $560 million were to settle on march 15, 2018. another contract, with a notional amount of $140 million and a settlement date of march 15, 2018 was converted to cash during the first quarter of 2010. accordingly, on settlement of the contracts, ppg will receive $1.16 billion and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts. the company has designated these swaps as hedges of its net investment in the acquired sigmakalon businesses and, as a result, mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps have been and will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate fair value of these swaps was a liability of $120 million and $163 million, respectively. a 10 percent increase in the value of the euro to the u.s. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $153 million and $158 million at december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. ppg had non-u.s. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $441 million as of december 31, 2011 and $447 million as of december 31, 2010. a weakening of the u.s. dollar by 10 percent against european currencies and by 20 percent against asian and south american currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $50 million and $52 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of ppg interest rate risk. as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 the notional value of outstanding interest rate swaps totaled $445 million and $450 million, respectively. the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of $26 million and $20 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the fair value of these swaps would have changed unfavorably by $1 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, if variable interest rates increased by 10 percent. a 10 percent increase in interest rates in the u.s., canada, mexico and europe and a 20 percent increase in interest rates in asia and south america would have affected ppg variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $1 million as of december 31, 2011 and december 31, 2010, respectively. further, a 10 percent reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the company fixed rate debt by approximately $ 90 million and $115 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on ppg annual earnings or cash flows. 30 2011 ppg annual report and form 10-k table of contents the company entered into forward starting swaps in 2009 and in the second quarter of 2010 to effectively lock-in a fixed interest rate for future debt refinancings with an anticipated term of ten years based on a the ten year swap rate, to which will be added a corporate spread. the notional amount of these swaps totaled $400 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the fair value of these swaps was a liability of $92 million as of december 31, 2011 and $21 million as of december 31, 2010. a 10 percent decline in interest rates would unfavorably affect the fair value of these swaps by $9 million and $14 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the fair value of natural gas swap contracts in place as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 was a liability of $9 million and $31 million, respectively. these contracts were entered into to reduce ppg exposure to higher prices of natural gas. a 10 percent reduction in the price of natural gas would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these contracts by increasing the liability by $2 million and $5 million at december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. an equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the company exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute ppg stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see note 11 derivative financial instruments and hedge activities and note 15, commitments and contingent liabilities, under item 8 of this form 10-k). the fair value of this instrument as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 was an asset of $56 million and $55 million, respectively. a 10 percent decrease in ppg stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $12 million at december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 2011 ppg annual report and form 10-k 31 table of contents
