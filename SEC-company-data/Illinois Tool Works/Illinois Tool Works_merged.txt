operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. weakness or downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. during 2012, north american economic conditions were stronger than the european and asia pacific economic environments as european sales declined and growth in asia slowed. the company cannot give assurance that it will not experience adverse effects from broad economic trends in europe, asia or other geographies. instability in global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 58 countries. in 2012, approximately 57% of the company's revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the u.s. as the company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales may represent an increasing portion of the company's revenues. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; 8 limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully manage its enterprise initiatives, financial results could be adversely impacted. the company has begun executing the following new long-term enterprise initiatives: business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and portfolio management. these initiatives include the scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses, better leveraging of purchasing power, and divesting non-core assets while targeting acquisitions with strong differentiation and growth potential. if the company is unable to retain its key employees, successfully integrate acquisitions, maintain productivity or otherwise implement these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, financial results could be adversely impacted. divestitures could negatively impact the company's business, and retained liabilities from businesses that the company sells could adversely affect the company's financial results. as part of its portfolio management initiative, the company reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. as a result, the company expects its divestiture activity in the 2012 to 2014 period to increase over historical periods. divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact the company's business, including the potentially dilutive effect on earnings per share, distraction of management's attention from core businesses, potential disputes with buyers and potential impairment charges. in addition, the company may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities related to the businesses sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and return on invested capital. acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's growth and profitability: any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable. acquisitions could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated. the realization of any of these liabilities may increase the company's expenses or adversely affect its financial position. as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery or other laws. the company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls will always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery laws, competition, and export and import compliance. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, and could damage its reputation. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and 9 incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. diminished credit availability could adversely impact the company's ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain cost-effective financing. the company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its short-term liquidity needs. if conditions in the financial markets decline, there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to the company or that the lenders participating in the company's long-term credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of its credit agreements. a failure of one or more of the syndicate members in the company's credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect the company's liquidity. if the company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, funds may not be available on cost-effective terms. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains 10 adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, plans, intends, may, strategy, prospects, estimate, project, target,

ability to fund debt service obligations, the company's portion of future benefit payments related to pension and postretirement benefits, the availability of additional financing, the availability of raw materials and energy, the expiration of any one of the company's patents, the cost of compliance with environmental regulations, the likelihood of future goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings, the impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, and the estimated timing and amount related to the resolution of tax matters. these statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. important risks that may influence future results include those risks described above. these risks are not all inclusive and given these and other possible risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. any forward-looking statements made by itw speak only as of the date on which they are made. itw is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise. itw practices fair disclosure for all interested parties. investors should be aware that while itw regularly communicates with securities analysts and other investment professionals, it is against itw's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. shareholders should not assume that itw agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of its ongoing business operations including changes in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. interest rate risk the company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the company's fixed rate debt. the following table presents the company's debt for which fair value is subject to changing market interest rates: 5.15% notes due 5.25% euro notes due 6.25% notes due 4.88% notes due thru 3.375% notes due 4.875% notes due 3.9% notes due in millions apr 1, 2014 oct 1, 2014 apr 1, 2019 dec 31, 2020 sep 15, 2021 sep 15, 2041 sep 1, 2042 as of december 31, 2012: estimated cash outflow by

currency risk the company operates in the u.s. and 57 foreign countries. in general, the company's products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. the initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the u.s. parent company. therefore, the company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. as such, the company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at december 31, 2012 or 2011. in october 2007, the company issued 750 million of 5.25% euro notes due october 1, 2014. the company has significant operations with the euro as their functional currency. the company believes that the euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes. 38risk factors. executive

limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. weakness or downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, credit market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. 8 the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 56 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully manage its enterprise initiatives, the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the company has completed the first year of its five year enterprise strategy and associated initiatives: portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. these initiatives include divesting assets that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives, the scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses and better leveraging of purchasing power. if the company is unable to retain its key employees, maintain productivity or otherwise implement these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. the company previously announced its intention to fully offset the divestiture-related eps dilution from the proposed sale of the industrial packaging segment through share repurchases. the company currently plans to fund the repurchases through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or delay the company's stock repurchases include unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash. if we delay, limit or suspend the company's stock repurchase program, the company's stock price may be negatively affected. divestitures could negatively impact the company's business, and retained liabilities from businesses that the company sells could adversely affect the company's financial results. as part of its portfolio management initiative, the company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. as a result, the company's divestiture activity increased over historical periods in 2012 and 2013 and is expected to increase further in 2014 with the planned divestiture of the industrial packaging segment. divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact the company's business, including the potentially dilutive effect on earnings per share, distraction of management's attention from core businesses, potential disputes with buyers and potential impairment charges. in addition, the company may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities related to the businesses sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. 9 the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery or other laws. the company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls will always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery laws, competition, and export and import compliance. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its growth, profitability and returns. acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's growth, profitability and returns: any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable. acquisitions could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated. the realization of any of these liabilities may increase the company's expenses or adversely affect its financial position. as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets. diminished credit availability could adversely impact the company's ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain cost-effective financing. the company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its short-term liquidity needs. if conditions in the financial markets decline, there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to the company or that the lenders participating in the company's long-term credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of its credit agreements. a failure of one or more of the syndicate members in the company's credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect the company's liquidity. if the company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, funds may not be available on cost-effective terms. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and 10 services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking

foreign currency risk the company operates in the u.s. and 55 foreign countries. in general, the company's products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. the initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the u.s. parent company. therefore, the company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. as such, the company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at december 31, 2013 or 2012 . in october 2007, the company, through a wholly-owned european subsidiary, issued 750 million of 5.25% euro notes due october 1, 2014. the company has significant operations with the euro as their functional currency. the company believes that the euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes. 38risk factors 10 risk factors. 8 executive officers executive officers of the company as of february 13, 2015 were as follows: name office age e. scott santi president

condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition. the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in 10 collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, and increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 57 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the timing and amount of benefits from the company's 2013 - 2017 enterprise initiatives may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the company's 2013 - 2017 enterprise strategy and associated initiatives include portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. the portfolio management initiative, which included divesting businesses no longer aligned with the company's long-term objectives, is essentially complete; however, product line simplification and customer base simplification, which is a core element of the company's 80/20 business process, is being reapplied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remains an active element of this initiative. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they may have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. the company has made significant progress on its business structure simplification and strategic sourcing initiatives, but scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses and leveraging purchasing power across businesses involves some execution risk. if the company is unable to achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free operating cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash. the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws. the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, 11 could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results. the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. in the past the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could result that adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit. global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished. 12 raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "plans," "intends," "may," "strategy," "prospects," "estimate," "project," "target," "anticipate," "guidance," "forecast," and other similar words, including, without limitation, statements regarding the expected acquisition or disposition of businesses, economic conditions in various geographic regions, the timing and amount of share repurchases, the company's enterprise strategy and its ability to manage its strategic business initiatives and the timing and amount of benefits therefrom, the adequacy of internally generated funds and credit facilities, the ability to fund debt service obligations, the cost and availability of additional financing, the company's portion of future benefit payments related to pension and postretirement benefits, the availability of raw materials and energy, the expiration of any one of the company's patents, the cost of compliance with environmental regulations, the likelihood of future goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, the impact of failure of the company's employees to comply with applicable laws and regulations, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings, the impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, and the estimated timing and amount related to the resolution of tax matters. these statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. important risks that may influence future results include those risks described above. these risks are not all inclusive and given these and other possible risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. 13 any forward-looking statements made by itw speak only as of the date on which they are made. itw is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise. itw practices fair disclosure for all interested parties. investors should be aware that while itw regularly communicates with

should not assume that itw agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of its ongoing business operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. interest rate risk the company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the company's fixed rate debt.

for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the u.s. parent company. the company's products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. therefore, the company's manufacturing operations do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. in october 2007, the company, through a wholly-owned european subsidiary, issued 750 million of 5.25% euro notes due october 1, 2014, which were paid on the due date. in addition, in may 2014, the company issued 500 million of 1.75% euro notes due may 20, 2022 and 500 million of 3.0% euro notes due may 19, 2034. the company designated the 1.0 billion of euro notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income. the unrealized gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge was $158 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. 42risk factors 10 risk factors. 8 executive officers executive officers of the company

which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition. the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, and increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 57 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; 10 limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the timing and amount of benefits from the company's enterprise initiatives may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the company's enterprise strategy and associated initiatives include portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. the portfolio management initiative, which included divesting businesses no longer aligned with the company's long-term objectives, is essentially complete; however, product line and customer base simplification, which is a core element of the company's 80/20 management process, is being reapplied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remains an active element of this initiative. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. the company's business structure simplification initiative is also essentially completed, although efforts to realize efficiencies in structure are continuous. in addition, the company continues to seek to benefit from its size and scale in the procurement process through its strategic sourcing initiatives, and the leveraging of purchasing power across businesses involves some execution risk. also, as its portfolio and 80/20 management activities have positioned its businesses for profitable growth, the company has shifted its focus to organic growth and has expressed its belief that organic growth will be 200 basis points above global gdp by the end of 2017. if the company is unable to achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash. the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws. the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation. 11 a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results. the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. in the past the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could result that adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit. global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts 12 prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; or computer viruses. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.

rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for

primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the u.s. parent company. the company's products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. therefore, the company's manufacturing operations do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. the company designated 1.0 billion of euro notes issued in may 2014 and 1.0 billion of euro notes issued in may 2015 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). the cumulative unrealized gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $308 million and $158 million as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 , respectively. 39risk factors 10 risk factors. executive officers executive officers of the company as of february 10, 2017 were as follows: name

which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition. the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe, including the uncertainty created by the united kingdom's june 2016 vote to leave the european union. slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts 10 receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 57 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. the united kingdom's vote in june 2016 to leave the european union may increase certain of the risks and uncertainties described above. the united kingdom represented approximately 5% of the company's total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. as the company has substantially completed its enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification, its focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement. product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the company's 80/20 management process, continue to be applied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash. the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws. the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation. 11 a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns. acquisitions, including the company's acquisition of the engineered fasteners and components business on july 1, 2016 from zf trw, involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's profitability and returns: the acquired business could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable. the acquired business could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. the acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired business's activities. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations. as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets. recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results. the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. 12 the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could result that adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit. global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. 13 if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; attacks by computer hackers; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. forward-looking statements this

primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital. the company's products are typically manufactured and sold within the same country. therefore, the company's manufacturing operations generally do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. the company designated 1.0 billion of euro notes issued in may 2014 and 1.0 billion of euro notes issued in may 2015 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other 40 comprehensive income (loss). the cumulative unrealized gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $375 million and $308 million as

the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition. the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 56 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. as the company has substantially completed its enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification, its focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement. product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the company's 80/20 front to back process, continue to be applied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment 11 opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash. the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws. the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected. if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns. the company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's profitability and returns: the acquired business could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable. the acquired business could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. the acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may 12 increase the company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations. as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets. past divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results. the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial results. the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could result that adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the company's credit ratings could increase the company's funding costs or reduce the availability of credit. global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. the u.s. government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. the company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax, however the ultimate impact of this tax reform is uncertain due to subsequent clarification of the tax law and refinement of estimated amounts and the company's business and financial condition could be adversely affected. 13 the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. uncertainty related to climate change regulation and industry standards could impact the company's results of operations and financial position. increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products, they could negatively impact the company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; attacks by computer hackers; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of

operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. interest rate risk the company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the company's fixed rate debt. refer to note 8. debt inrisk factors 10 risk factors the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition. the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, financial market instability, natural disasters, public health crises, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, causing production delays, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. over 50% of the company's net sales are derived from customers outside the united states, and the company currently operates in 55 countries. the risks inherent in the company's global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures; government actions impacting international trade agreements; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the current global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. further changes in u.s. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs), additional retaliatory actions by u.s. trade partners, or worsening of economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. with the initial enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification largely complete, the company's focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement. product line and 10 customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the company's 80/20 front-to-back process, continue to be applied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the company's financial results could be adversely impacted. the timing and amount of the company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash. the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws. the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the company's operating income. although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected. if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. 11 the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns. the company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's profitability and returns: the acquired business could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable. the acquired business could cause the company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. the acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations. as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets. past divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results. the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative, and the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, which could adversely affect the company's financial results. the company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial results. the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the company's credit ratings could increase the company's funding costs or reduce the availability of credit. global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. in particular, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs and potential retaliatory countermeasures could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 12 unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. in december 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that included significant changes to the taxation of business entities. the company's accounting for the tax effects of the act may be subject to change due to subsequent clarification of the tax law which could adversely affect the company's operating results or financial condition. the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows. the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. uncertainty related to climate change regulation and industry standards could impact the company's results of operations and financial position. increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products, they could negatively impact the company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if there is a violation of data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; attacks by computer hackers; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. we are also subject to data privacy laws, including the eu general data protection regulation, in the various countries in which we operate. if our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, or if we violate data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage. 13 forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking

increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. further changes in u.s. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and additional retaliatory actions by u.s. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. additionally, in early 2020, an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred in china and other jurisdictions. the extent of the outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the company and on its operations is uncertain. a prolonged outbreak could interrupt the operations of the company and its customers and suppliers. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results

of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. a downturn or further downturn in the markets served by the company could materially adversely affect results. substantially all of the company businesses directly or indirectly serve markets that were adversely impacted by the recent global economic crisis. although improvement is expected, the timing of any economic recovery in the markets we serve remains uncertain. a further downturn in one or more of our significant markets could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 57 countries. in 2009, approximately 57% of the company revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the united states. as the company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales may represent an increasing portion of the company revenues. the risks inherent in our global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; 8 table of contents transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. as part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses in the ordinary course. our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability: any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results, particularly in light of the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to business combinations, which applies to any acquisition completed in 2009 or later. under the new accounting guidance, we are required to expense a number of acquisition-related items that under previous accounting rules did not impact our income statement. acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. we may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated. the realization of any of these liabilities may increase our expenses or adversely affect our financial position. as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income. although the company financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in 9 table of contents relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. further diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing. a further deterioration in world financial markets and decreases in credit availability could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to increase. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be impaired. the company ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company competitive position. protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company competitive position and results of operations. an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company growth rate. the company has historically followed a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its growth rate could be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. 10 table of contents potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the future. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, that may be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, plans, strategy, prospects, estimate, project, target, anticipate, guidance, and other similar words, including, without limitation, statements regarding the availability of raw materials and energy, the

content of the statement or report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk interest rate risk the company exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company debt. the company had commercial paper outstanding of $135.5 million and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper was 0.1% at december 31, 2009 and 1.4% at december 31, 2008. the following table presents the company debt for which fair

states and 56 other countries. in general, the company products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. the initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the u.s. parent company. therefore, the company and its subsidiaries do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. as such, the company does not have any significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at december 31, 2009 or 2008. in october 2007, the company issued 750.0 million of 5.25% euro notes due october 1, 2014. the company has significant operations with the euro as their functional currency. the company believes that the euro cash flows from these businesses will be adequate to fund the debt obligations under these notes. 37 table of contentsrisk factors risk factors. executive officers

but not limited to those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. an interruption or slowdown of economic recovery in the markets served by the company could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition. although recently most of our end markets have shown significant recovery from the global recession, we cannot be certain that the recovery will continue globally as anticipated. an interruption or slowdown of the economic recovery in one or more of our significant markets could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

significant derivatives or other financial instruments that are subject to foreign currency risk at december 31, 2010 or 2009. in october 2007, the company issued 750.0 million of 5.25% euro notes due

incorporated by reference to pages 46 and 47 of the company 2005 annual report to stockholders.risk factors risk factors the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, the company is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other u.s.-based global industrial manufacturers, although the company believes that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end markets that its businesses serve mitigates the possibility that any single risk factor will materially adversely effect the company consolidated financial position. a downturn in the major markets served by the company may adversely affect results. while the company businesses serve a broad array of end markets, a sustained downturn in the construction, general industrial, automotive or food institutional and service markets could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operation or financial condition. deterioration in international and domestic business and economic conditions may have a material adverse affect on the company result of operations. the company currently has approximately 750 business units in 49 countries. in 2006, approximately 45% of the company revenues were generated outside of the united states. as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales will represent an ever increasing portion of the company revenues. deterioration in either international or domestic business and economic conditions could occur as a result of a number of factors including: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; 9 labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding its international business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. unfavorable impact of increases in raw materials which could adversely affect results. the company supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company results of operations and profit margins. while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company ability to increase the prices of its products, or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors. the company suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their component parts. in those circumstances, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. the company future growth is in part, dependent upon introducing new products and preserving its intellectual property. the company ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company competitive position. protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company competitive position and results of operations. an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company future growth. the company completed 53 acquisitions in 2006 resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of acquired annualized revenue. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its ability to continue to grow the company could be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the 10 company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company tax liabilities. potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate insurance program consisting of a self-insured retention and excess insurance above that layer. there can be no assurance, however, that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance program will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. even if it maintains an adequate insurance program, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this information is incorporated by reference from pages 45 and 46 of

statement of principles of conduct; code of ethics for ceo and key financial and accounting personnel; charters of the audit, corporate governance and nominating and compensation committees of the board of directors; and corporate governance guidelines. item 1a. risk factors the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, the company is subject to substantially the same risk factors as other u.s.-based global industrial manufacturers, although the company 8 believes that its decentralized structure and the broad array of end markets that its businesses serve help to mitigate the possibility that any single risk factor will materially adversely affect the company consolidated financial position. a downturn or further downturn in certain of the major markets served by the company could materially adversely affect results. certain of the company businesses directly or indirectly serve the construction, general industrial, automotive or food institutional/restaurant and service markets. the current global economic crisis has caused downturns in many industrial markets and severe downturns in several markets, including the construction and automotive markets. there can be no assurance as to when economic conditions will improve. a further or unexpectedly sustained downturn in one or more of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversly affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently has approximately 875 business units in 54 countries. in 2008, approximately 59% of the company revenues were generated outside of the united states. as the company continues to expand its global footprint these sales may represent an ever increasing portion of the company revenues. the risks inherent in our global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. a significant currency fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income. although the company financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other foreign currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. further diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing. recent economic conditions have not materially impaired our ability to access credit or obtain appropriate financing. there can be no assurance, however, that there will not be a further deterioration in world financial markets and decreases in credit availability. such further deterioration could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing when desired or cause the cost of financing to increase. 9 raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversly affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company results of operations and profit margins. while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material and component parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased prices to the company and the company ability to increase the prices of its products, or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be impaired. the company ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company competitive position. protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company competitive position and results of operations. an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company future growth. the company has historically followed a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its ability to continue to grow could be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance, however, that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance in the future. 10 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this information is

including, but not limited to those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the company results are impacted by global economic conditions. weakness or downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. during 2010 and 2011, many of our end markets showed improvement in general economic conditions, but european economic conditions slowed in the second half of 2011. we cannot be assured that we will not experience adverse effects from broad economic trends in europe or other geographies. instability in global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. the global nature of our operations subjects the company to political and economic risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the company currently operates in 58 countries. in 2011, approximately 59% of the company revenues were generated from sales to customers outside of the u.s. as the company continues to expand its global footprint, these sales may represent an increasing portion of the company revenues. the risks inherent in our global operations include: fluctuation in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; acts of terrorism; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. as part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses in the ordinary course. our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability: 7 any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. we may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated. the realization of any of these liabilities may increase our expenses or adversely affect our financial position. as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. we may incur fines or penalties, damage to our reputation or other adverse consequences if our employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery or other laws. we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery laws, competition, and export and import compliance. any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation. a significant fluctuation between the u.s. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income. although the company financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. diminished credit availability could adversely impact our ability to readily obtain financing or to obtain cost-effective financing. the company may utilize the commercial paper markets for a portion of its short-term liquidity needs. if conditions in the financial markets decline, there is no assurance that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving and long-term credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of our credit agreements. a failure of one or more of the syndicate members in our credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and adversely affect our liquidity. if we determine that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, funds may not be available on cost-effective terms. raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results. the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected. the company ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company competitive position. protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company competitive position and results of operations. 8 an unfavorable environment for making acquisitions may adversely affect the company growth rate. suitable acquisitions can be difficult to complete due to high valuations for attractive acquisitions, competition among prospective buyers, the need for antitrust or other regulatory approval and the availability of affordable financing. changes in regulatory or accounting requirements or instability in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. our ability to grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify and successfully complete suitable acquisitions at appropriate prices. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find attractive businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts, its growth rate could be adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. potential adverse outcome in legal proceedings may adversely affect results. the company businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, successful claims could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking
