quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk. in december 2000 and january 2001, we entered into certain derivative financial contracts, which are variable-for-fixed swaps of interest payments payable on an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million of our term loan and certain variable operating lease commitments. our investments in iron mountain europe limited, iron mountain south america, ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in currency valuation. one of our canadian subsidiaries, iron mountain canada corporation, has u.s. dollar denominated debt. gains and losses due to exchange rate fluctuations related to this debt are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. after consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of december 31, 2001, we had $180.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.4%, and $1,315.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, such increase would have had a negative impact on our net income for the year ended december 31, 2001 of $1.2 million. see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2001.risk factors 12 risk factors" of this annual report. you should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. you should read these cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect

document, as well as our other periodic reports filed with the sec. iii table of contents item 1. business. business overview we store records, primarily physical records and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or life cycle stage. we offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, has more than 170,000 customers in a variety of industries in 37 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services and government organizations, including approximately 94% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2015, we employed more than 20,000 people. now in our 65th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996, at which time we operated fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of approximately $104.0 million. we are now a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with approximately 1,100 facilities (69.9 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. we are listed on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse"). we are a constituent of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index and the msci reit index and, as of december 31, 2015, we were number 726 on the fortune 1000. reit conversion consistent with our commitment to delivering stockholder value, and supported by our strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in february 2010 and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. in june 2012, we announced our intention to pursue reit conversion. the conversion plan was unanimously approved by our board of directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies. we have been organized and operating as a reit effective for our taxable year beginning january 1, 2014. since may 2012, we have returned $2.5 billion of capital to stockholders including $1.4 billion in cash and $1.1 billion in our common stock. in connection with our conversion to a reit and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for reits, on january 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our predecessor and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock. accordingly, references herein to our "common stock" refer to our common stock and the common stock of our predecessor, as applicable. proposed recall acquisition on june 8, 2015, we entered into the recall agreement with recall to acquire recall by way of recommended court approved scheme of arrangement (the "scheme"). the recall transaction, if consummated, would accelerate our already successful growth strategy. the combined company's broader footprint, stronger infrastructure, exposure to high growth emerging markets and small to mid-size enterprise customers and increased economies of scale will be well suited to address unmet document storage and information management needs around the globe. completion of the scheme is subject to customary closing conditions, as described more fully in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. the durability of our business a significant amount of activity generated in the information management industry is the result of legislative requirements. to varying degrees across the world, organizations are required by law to create certain records and to retain them for a specified period of time. these laws may also impose more stringent requirements on personal information regarded as being sensitive, such as financial and medical information. as a third party provider, we assist customers to improve data security and establish programs to ensure compliance with their regulatory obligations. storage of information can be performed in-house by businesses (unvended) or outsourced, in whole or in part, to a third party provider (vended). we believe the in-house portion still represents a majority of the total global information management market, offering a substantial unvended opportunity even in developed geographic markets with lower rates of economic growth. 1 table of contents we believe that the creation of document-based information will be sustained, as "paperless" technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of computer backup media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. ultimately, we expect that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. business strategy overview we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. our current strategy is focused on: (1) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, australia and western europe, primarily through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (2) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region, primarily through acquisitions; and (3) continuing to identify, incubate and scale adjacent business opportunities ("abos") to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. in our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest profit growth. in our existing emerging markets, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. however, any increases in our international profit margins will be limited as we continue to make acquisitions in new emerging markets. storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. there are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. we also expect to invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. in our developed markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. we also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through abos. we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services and data management services. we have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience, thereby enhancing our customer retention rates and attracting new customers. our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions, pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses, and developing adjacent businesses and real estate. we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services, based on our customers' evolving requirements. adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth from existing and new customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional records at a faster rate than old records are destroyed or permanently removed. the absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past four years, and we anticipate that this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth is slightly declining, given the continued growth in our total records volume. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service. 2 table of contents our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets. our sales force is dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of related services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our united states and international marketing organizations and senior management. we have developed tailored marketing strategies to target customers in the healthcare, financial, insurance, legal, life sciences, energy, business services and federal vertical market segments. growth through acquisitions the storage and information management services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. after 2004, acquisition activity was reduced as we focused on integrating these recent transactions and diversifying the business. beginning again in 2012, we saw opportunities for attractive acquisitions in emerging markets and consolidation opportunities in more developed markets, and resumed acquisition activity. we believe this ongoing acquisition activity is due to opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. attractive acquisition opportunities, in north america and internationally, many of which are small, continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present good returns and good opportunities to create value for our stockholders. lastly, we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating these businesses. we have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the united states, canada, australia and western europe. given the relatively small size of most attractive acquisition targets in these markets, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. occasionally, however, we may be presented with the opportunity to acquire one of the larger businesses in these markets and will evaluate each opportunity with a focus on return on invested capital and the creation of stockholder value. such was the case with our acquisition in october 2013 of cornerstone records management, llc and its affiliates. we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the united states, canada, australia and western europe. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. we expect that future acquisitions and investments in our emerging markets will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our emerging market acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations such that, as of december 31, 2015, we operated in 37 countries. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. we now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. 3 table of contents business characteristics. we generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base around the globe and providing an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue growth. services are a complementary part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, or document management solutions ("dms"), data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology escrow services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), and recurring project revenues. shredding consists primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations and the sale of recycled paper resulting from shredding services. secure storage our storage operations, our largest source of revenue, consist of providing non-dedicated storage rental space to our customers. non-dedicated space allows our customers to increase or decrease the volume of their physical storage over the life of the contract based on their storage needs, while also reducing their risk of loss in the event of natural disaster. given this non-dedicated space dynamic, the large portfolio of customer contracts, and the fact that no customer accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues as of the year ended december 31, 2015, we assess the performance of our storage rental business predominantly by analyzing trends in segment-level storage rental volume and storage rental revenue. additionally, our storage operations include technology escrow services. records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. the secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs. storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security. physical records storage physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. inactive physical records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer for long periods of time with limited activity. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. physical records may also include critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film, fine art and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. we continue to identify additional areas of physical storage that fit with our core competencies in security and transportation, seeking to provide enterprise storage to businesses in much the same manner that self-storage companies serve consumers. physical records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for these vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. electronic records storage electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. electronic storage consists of (i) storage of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery, including digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, and (ii) storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. 4 table of contents we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover their data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to offsite locations on a regular basis and to store multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. we expect continued increase in demand for computer media backup, as it provides off-line storage or storage that is not connected to the internet and provides superior protection against data breaches and hacks. in addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is an internet-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. service offerings complementary to any records management program is the handling and transportation and the eventual destruction of records upon the expiration of retention periods. these activities are accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2015, our courier fleet consisted of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles. our other services include information destruction services (primarily secure shredding), dms, compliant records management and consulting services, health information storage and management solutions, entertainment services, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. information destruction services our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations and typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. in addition, secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services by completing the lifecycle of a record and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the united states, canada and latin america. document management solutions (dms) the focus of our dms business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our dms services complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that complement and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their edm solutions. industry tailored services we offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as healthcare, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. for example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. in addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. 5 table of contents other ancillary services other services we provide include recurring project work, which involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both offsite at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at a customer's premises. other services that we provide include fulfillment and professional consulting services. business segments our north american records and information management business, north american data management business, western european business and our other international business segments offer storage and the information management services discussed above, in their respective geographies. the amount of revenues derived from our north american records and information management business, north american data management business, western european business, other international business and corporate and other business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. north american records and information management business our north american records and information management business segment provides storage and information management services, including the storage of physical records, including other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ( records management ); information destruction services ( destruction ); and dms throughout the united states and canada; as well as fulfillment services and intellectual property management in the united states. north american data management business our north american data management business segment provides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ( data protection &amp; recovery ); server and computer backup services; digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets; and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients throughout the united states and canada. western european business our western european business segment provides storage and information management services, including records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms throughout the united kingdom, ireland, austria, belgium, france, germany, netherlands, spain and switzerland. until december 2014, our western european business segment offered destruction in the united kingdom and ireland. other international business our other international business segment provides storage and information management services throughout the remaining european countries in which we operate, latin america and asia pacific, including records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms. our european operations included within the other international business segment provide records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms. our latin america operations provide records management, data protection &amp; recovery, destruction and dms throughout argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, mexico and peru. our asia pacific operations provide records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms throughout australia, with records management and data protection &amp; recovery also provided in certain cities in india, singapore, hong kong sar and china. until december 2014, our other international business segment offered destruction in australia. 6 table of contents corporate and other business our corporate and other business segment primarily consists of our data center and fine art storage businesses in the united states, the primary product offerings of our adjacent business operating segment (which was formerly referred to as our emerging business operating segment), as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. these costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. our corporate and other business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. abos, such as our data center and fine art storage businesses, are prospective business lines that we consider investing in to grow and diversify our business. we are seeking businesses with long-term, recurring revenue, preferably with storage rental attributes, which are consistent with and will enhance our reit structure. a dedicated team is focused on identifying and evaluating these opportunities. we have developed an innovation process that enables us to cautiously and effectively develop these abos to leverage our capabilities. if we are able to demonstrate success and meet return thresholds, we may potentially acquire businesses to further accelerate our growth in the relevant abo. importantly, the abo process includes financial hurdles and decision gates to help us evaluate whether we scale or scrap these opportunities, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation. with respect to our data center business, we believe that the growth rate of critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. a more recent example of an abo is our fine art storage business. on december 1, 2015 we completed the acquisition of crozier fine arts ("crozier"), a storage, logistics and transportation business for high-value paintings, photographs and other types of art belonging to individual collectors, galleries and art museums. crozier is a leader in art storage and an industry advocate for worldwide standards. this acquisition will build on our expertise in storing, protecting and managing high-value items and supports our strategy to leverage our real estate network to accelerate growth. the fine art storage industry is a growing, but fragmented, industry marked by increasing international interest and changes in acquisition and purchasing habits by collectors and museums. the increase in contemporary art as a focus for collectors has caused a spike in storage needs, while the increase in auction turnover the rate at which catalogs, collections and individual pieces are made available for auction has heightened the need for transportation, shipping, and related services. taken together, we believe these factors have the fine art storage industry poised for significant growth. 7 table of contents our business fundamentals our business fundamentals are based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. we generate attractive returns from our differentiated storage rental business model because our occupancy costs, whether in a leased or owned building, are incurred per square foot while our storage revenue is generally earned per cubic foot. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting profitability allows us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business fundamentals consist of: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. this stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and profitability. a customer is allocated a certain amount of storage space in our storage facilities but is not allocated a dedicated building or space in a particular building. in practice, we can, and sometimes will, for a variety of reasons, move records from one facility and into another facility. in order to track net move-in and move-out activity of customer materials, as well as to assess the optimization of our real estate portfolio, we regularly assess the utilization of our overall real estate portfolio. on a per building basis, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the entire building assuming it was fully racked ("total building utilization"). additionally, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the racking that has been installed ("total racking utilization"). as of december 31, 2015, our total building utilization and total racking utilization were approximately 84% and 92%, respectively, for our records management business and our total building utilization and total racking utilization were approximately 69% and 81%, respectively, for our data management business. we occasionally offer inducements to our customers in order to generate new business opportunities. such inducements most commonly come in the form of providing free intake costs to transport a customer's records to one of our facilities, including labor and transportation costs ("move costs"), or payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate the customer's existing contract with that vendor ("permanent withdrawal fees"). we capitalize move costs and permanent withdrawal fees (collectively, "customer inducements") as customer acquisition costs. historically non-cyclical storage rental business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns. we believe the durability of our storage rental business is driven by a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, as well as customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. the absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past four years, and we anticipate this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth is slightly declining, given the continued growth in the total records volume. total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 6%, 4% and 2% on a global basis for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2015, we had more than 170,000 customers in a variety of industries in 37 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services and government organizations, including approximately 94% of the fortune 1000. no single customer accounted for as much as 1% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. for each of the three years 2013 through 2015, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was approximately 2%. 8 table of contents capital allocation. all the characteristics of our business noted above support the durability of our cash flows, which in turn support our dividends and a portion of our investments. absent a large acquisition or significant investments in real estate, we generally generate cash flows to support our dividends, maintain our operations and infrastructure and invest in core growth opportunities. we plan on funding acquisitions, abo investments and real estate investments primarily through incremental borrowing at a targeted leverage ratio and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity, dependent on market conditions. below are descriptions of the major types of investments and other capital expenditures that we have made in recent years or that we are likely to consider in 2016: real estate: assets that support core business growth primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies, or real estate investment. real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures, or real estate maintenance. non-real estate: non-real estate assets that either (i) support the growth of our business, and/or increase our profitability, such as customer-inventory technology systems, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhance our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements, or non-real estate investment. assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements, or non-real estate

competition we are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 37 countries as of december 31, 2015. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. 9 table of contents we also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. the physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. to date, none of the alternative technologies has replaced physical documents as the primary means for storing information. we continue to provide, primarily through partnerships, additional services such as online backup, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high-quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. employees as of december 31, 2015, we employed more than 8,000 employees in the united states and more than 12,000 employees outside of the united states. at december 31, 2015, fewer than 650 employees were represented by unions in california, illinois, georgia and three provinces in canada. all union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. certain unionized employees in california receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability for damages with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our dms services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we can provide no assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. 10 table of contents environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. corporate responsibility we are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiative. our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for

circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. risks related to the recall transaction the integration of recall will subject us to liabilities that may exist at recall or may arise in connection with the consummation of the recall transaction. our integration with recall may pose special risks, including one-time write-offs or restructuring charges, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees. there can be no assurance that our integration with recall will be accomplished effectively or in a timely manner. in addition, our integration with recall will subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at recall or may arise in connection with the consummation of the recall transaction, some of which may be unknown. although we and our advisors have conducted due diligence on the operations of recall, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of recall. these liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the recall transaction not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. the price of our common stock and our results of operations after the recall transaction may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the price of our common stock and our results of operations. recall's business is different in certain ways from ours, and our results of operations, as well as the price of our common stock after the recall transaction, may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the results of our operations and the price of our common stock. the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly following the recall transaction, including as a result of factors over which we and recall have no control. current stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in us if the recall transaction is consummated or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their shares of our common stock. if, following the consummation of the recall transaction, there is selling pressure on our common stock that exceeds demand at the market price, the price of our common stock could decline. in addition, if the recall transaction is completed, the recall shareholders will own a significant percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company, and they may determine not to hold their shares of our common stock following the recall transaction, which may result in additional pressure on the price of our common stock. we will incur significant transaction and combination-related costs in connection with the recall transaction. we and recall expect to incur significant costs associated with the recall transaction and combining the operations of the two companies, some of which will be paid regardless of whether we are able to complete the recall transaction. in this regard, we expect to incur approximately $80.0 million of costs, including advisory and professional fees, to complete the recall transaction ( recall deal close costs ) and approximately $300.0 million of costs to integrate recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, reit conversion and system upgrade costs ("recall integration costs"). despite our current estimates, it is difficult to predict the amount of these costs, and we may incur additional unanticipated costs as a consequence of difficulties arising from efforts to integrate the companies. we will need additional debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, in order to consummate the recall transaction. we currently anticipate that we will need to raise additional debt financing to consummate the recall transaction. such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing and consummate the recall transaction, we may be subject to significant monetary or other damages under the recall agreement. the recall agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the recall transaction, and in certain instances requires payment of a reimbursement fee, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction to the recall transaction. while the recall agreement is in effect, subject to certain limited exceptions, we are prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination, with any third party. as a result of these limitations, we may lose opportunities to enter into a more favorable transaction than the recall transaction. moreover, under specified circumstances, we could be required to pay recall a reimbursement fee of a$25.5 million in connection with the termination of the recall agreement. the reimbursement fee could deter a third party from proposing an alternative to the recall transaction. 12 table of contents the recall transaction is subject to conditions to closing that could result in the recall transaction being delayed or not completed and the recall agreement can be terminated in certain circumstances, each of which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and our future business and operations. consummation of the recall transaction is subject to conditions, including, among others: the approval by the recall shareholders of the recall transaction; the approval of the scheme by the federal court of australia, sydney registry (the sydney federal court ) (or such other competent court agreed by us and recall); the absence of any law, order or injunction that would prohibit, restrain or make illegal the recall transaction; the receipt of regulatory approvals; the approval for listing on the nyse of our common stock to be issued in the recall transaction and the establishment of a secondary listing on the australian securities exchange (the "asx") to allow shareholders of recall to trade our common stock via chess depository interests on the asx; the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance with the respective covenants of the parties, subject to specified materiality qualifiers; and no events having occurred that would have a material adverse effect on recall or us. in addition, we and recall each has the right, in certain circumstances, to terminate the recall agreement. if the recall agreement is terminated or any of the conditions to closing are not satisfied and, where permissible, not waived, the recall transaction will not be completed. failure to complete the recall transaction or any delay in the completion of the recall transaction or any uncertainty about the completion of the recall transaction may adversely affect the price of our common stock or have an adverse impact on our future business and operations. if the recall transaction is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the recall transaction, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: negative reactions from the financial markets; incurring and paying significant expenses in connection with the recall transaction, such as recall deal costs and recall integration costs; paying a reimbursement fee of a$25.5 million if the recall agreement is terminated in certain circumstances; and paying a reimbursement fee of a$76.5 million if the recall agreement is terminated due to our inability to obtain the necessary antitrust/competition approvals required to consummate the recall transaction. in addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the recall transaction or seeking to require us to perform our obligations under the recall agreement. the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either recall's share price or our stock price. subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the recall agreement, after the effective date of the scheme and upon the completion of the recall transaction, each outstanding ordinary share of recall will be transferred to us in exchange for the australian dollar equivalent of us$0.50 in cash for each outstanding share of recall common stock (the "cash supplement") as well as either (1) 0.1722 of a newly issued share of our common stock or (2) 8.50 australian dollars less the australian dollar equivalent of us$0.50 in cash for each recall share (the "cash election"). the cash election is subject to a proration mechanism that will cap the total amount of cash paid to recall shareholders electing the cash election at 225.0 million australian dollars (the "cash election cap"). the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either recall shares or our shares. changes in the price of our shares prior to completion of the scheme may affect the market value that holders of recall shares will receive on the date of the effective time for the scheme. share price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond our or recall's control). if the share price of our common stock increases before the closing of the recall transaction, recall shareholders will receive shares of our common stock that have a market value that is greater than the current market value of such shares. alternatively, if the share price of our common stock decreases before the closing of the recall transaction, recall shareholders will receive shares of our common stock that have a market value that is less than the current market value of such shares. therefore, because the exchange ratio is fixed, prior to the closing of the recall transaction, our stockholders and recall shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the share consideration that will be paid to recall shareholders upon completion of the recall transaction. 13 table of contents obtaining required governmental and court approvals necessary to satisfy closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the recall transaction or may impose material terms and conditions, including asset divestitures, which could negatively impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the recall transaction. completion of the recall transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals, including (i) approvals, clearances, filings or expiration or termination of waiting periods required in relation to the recall transaction under antitrust laws of australia, canada, the united states, and the united kingdom and (ii) approval by the sydney federal court (or such other competent court agreed to by us and recall). in the recall agreement, we agreed to offer, negotiate and agree to divestitures and/or similar restraints with respect to our or recall's businesses, services or assets, except that we are not required to agree to divestitures or similar restraints with respect to our assets or recall's records management businesses in the united states and canada that, in the aggregate, generated more than us$30.0 million in revenues during the twelve-month period prior to the date of the recall agreement (the divestiture threshold ). no assurance can be given that the antitrust/competition approvals will be obtained. in the event that the recall agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain the antitrust/competition approvals, subject to certain limited exceptions, we will be obligated to pay recall a reimbursement fee of a$76.5 million. antitrust/competition approval, if obtained, is likely to be conditioned on the divestiture of certain assets in australia, canada, the united states and/or the united kingdom, including the divestiture of assets in the united states and canada that, in the aggregate, may exceed the divestiture threshold. if we divest more assets than we anticipated when we entered into the recall agreement, the benefits that we originally expected to realize from the recall transaction could be reduced. moreover, to the extent that the current price of our common stock reflects an assumption that asset divestitures will be less than what may ultimately be required by antitrust/competition agencies in australia, canada, the united states and/or the united kingdom in order to consummate the recall transaction, the price per share for our common stock could be negatively impacted. following the recall transaction, our exposure to foreign exchange translation risk will be increased. we are currently subject to foreign exchange translation risk because we conduct business operations in several foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which conduct business in their respective local currencies. recall conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the united states through its foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which also operate in their respective local currencies. therefore, following the completion of the recall transaction, our international operations will account for a more significant portion of our overall operations than they do presently. because our financial statements will continue to be presented in united states dollars subsequent to the recall transaction, the local currencies will be translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international storage and information management services businesses will continue to be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and due to the recall transaction, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will increase. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in certain circumstances, if the recall agreement is terminated without any payment of a termination payment by recall, we may not be fully reimbursed for our out of pocket expenses. under the recall agreement, recall would be required to reimburse us for our reasonable, documented out of pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with the recall transaction up to a maximum of $5.0 million if (i) the recall board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation that recall shareholders vote in favor of the resolution to approve the recall transaction as a result of the report of the independent expert opining that the recall transaction is not in the best interests of recall's shareholders (other than where the reason for such opinion is a recall competing transaction) and (ii) the recall agreement is terminated by recall or us prior to the recall shareholders meeting. given that such reimbursed expenses cannot exceed $5.0 million, we may not be fully reimbursed for our out of pocket expenses in the event of such a termination. our due diligence of recall may have failed to identify key issues that could have an adverse effect on our performance and financial condition. before executing the recall agreement, we and recall undertook a period of mutual due diligence for the purpose of negotiating the terms of the recall transaction. although we and recall decided to proceed with the recall transaction following that due diligence exercise, there is a risk that the due diligence undertaken was insufficient or failed to identify key issues. furthermore, after implementation of the recall transaction, we will be subject to any unknown liabilities of recall which could have an adverse effect on our performance and financial condition. 14 table of contents we will guarantee certain obligations of recall to brambles relating to brambles' prior demerger transaction. on december 18, 2013, brambles limited, an australian corporation ("brambles"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of recall to brambles' shareholders (the demerger ). prior to and in connection with the demerger, brambles spun off certain of its united states and canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to recall. such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under united states and canadian tax laws, respectively, and brambles obtained rulings from the irs (with respect to the united states spin-off) and the canada revenue agency (with respect to the canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. however, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such united states subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such united states subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off. in connection with the demerger, recall agreed to indemnify brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by recall (e.g., an acquisition of recall shares) resulted in the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for united states or canadian tax purposes, respectively. in addition, recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the united states spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin-offs failing to be tax-free under united states federal income tax law or canadian tax law, respectively. recall has obtained or intends to obtain such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by recall and us. such opinions, once accepted by brambles, do not affect recall's obligation to indemnify brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs. the delivery of those opinions is a condition to our obligation to consummate the recall transaction. we have agreed, contingent on the consummation of the recall transaction, to guarantee the foregoing indemnification obligations of recall. consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that the recall transaction is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off, respectively. however, if the irs or the canadian revenue agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we and recall would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material. risks related to us and recall the failure to integrate successfully recall's business with our business in the expected time frame would adversely affect our future results. the success of the recall transaction will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining recall's businesses with ours. to realize these anticipated benefits, our business and recall's must be successfully integrated. this integration will be complex and time-consuming. the failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in us not fully achieving the anticipated benefits of the recall transaction. potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: challenges and difficulties associated with managing the larger, more complex, combined company; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the entities; integrating personnel from the two entities while maintaining focus on developing, producing and delivering consistent, high quality services; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the recall transaction; performance shortfalls at one or both of the entities as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the recall transaction and integrating the entities' operations; and our ability to deliver on our strategy going forward. 15 table of contents we will incur adverse tax consequences if the combined company following the recall transaction fails to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes. we believe that, following the recall transaction, we will integrate recall's assets and operations in a manner that will allow us to timely satisfy the reit income, asset, and distribution tests applicable to us. however, if we fail to do so, we could jeopardize or lose our qualification for taxation as a reit, particularly if we were ineligible to utilize relief provisions set forth in the code. for any taxable year that we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our stockholders in computing our taxable income, and thus would be subject to united states federal and state income tax at the regular corporate rates on all of our united states federal and state taxable income in the manner of a regular corporation. those corporate level taxes would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders or for reinvestment or other purposes, and would adversely affect our earnings. as a result, our failure to qualify for taxation as a reit during any taxable year could have a material adverse effect upon us and our stockholders. furthermore, unless prescribed relief provisions apply, we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit. finally, even if we are able to utilize relief provisions and thereby avoid disqualification for taxation as a reit, relief provisions typically involve paying a penalty tax in proportion to the severity and duration of the noncompliance with reit requirements, and thus these penalty taxes could be significant in the context of noncompliance stemming from a transaction as large as the recall transaction. the recall transaction, if completed, will dilute the ownership position of our current stockholders. if the recall transaction is completed, the recall shareholders are expected to beneficially own a significant percentage of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. consequently, our current stockholders will own a smaller proportion of our common stock than the proportion of common stock they owned before the recall transaction and, as a result, they will have less influence on our management and policies following the recall transaction than they now have on our management and policies. our and recall's business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the recall transaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and recall's results of operations, cash flows and financial position and, following the completion of the recall transaction, the combined company. parties with which we and recall do business may experience uncertainty associated with the recall transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, recall or the combined company following the completion of the recall transaction. our and recall's relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we and recall have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or recall, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or recall. these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of us, recall or the combined company following the completion of the recall transaction, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the recall transaction. the risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the recall transaction or the termination of the recall agreement. risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. we have elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply. qualification for taxation as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates; and we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. 16 table of contents if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced. as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax. we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions, and, to achieve maximum tax efficiency and retain cash to allow us to make selective discretionary investments, we currently anticipate our typical regular quarterly distributions will be based on a payment of approximately 100% of our reit taxable income; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code. we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. this would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. a downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks relating to our indebtedness." whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. in addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a reit. as a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 17 table of contents legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. at any time, the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the united states internal revenue service (the "irs"), the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing. we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. beginning in our 2018 taxable year, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one more more trss within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss. as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss. our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability. in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements. our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. beginning with our 2018 taxable year, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. 18 table of contents our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. a reit generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income to its stockholders. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit. our information management services businesses are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate (currently 35%) on gain recognized from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2014, or (ii) an asset that we hold in a qrs following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this 35% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset (e.g., january 1, 2014 in the case of reit assets we held at the time of our reit conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. in addition, depreciation recapture income that we expect to recognize in connection with the recall transaction as a result of accounting method changes that we will make will be fully subject to this 35% tax. in addition, the irs and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for our pre-reit period, in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. moreover, any increase in taxable income for these pre-reit periods will likely result in an increase in pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-united states operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future taxable income in the trss. 19 table of contents we have limited experience operating as a reit, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock, ability to forecast dividends and ability to satisfy debt service obligations. we began operating as a reit on january 1, 2014 and, as such, have limited operating history as a reit. in addition, prior to january 1, 2014 our senior management team had no prior experience operating a reit. we can provide no assurance that our past experience has sufficiently prepared us to operate successfully as a reit. our inability to operate successfully as a reit, including the failure to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates. qualifying distributions payable by corporations to individuals, trusts and estates that are united states stockholders are currently eligible for federal income tax at preferential rates. distributions payable by reits, in contrast, generally are not eligible for the preferential rates. the preferential rates applicable to regular corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-reit corporations that pay distributions, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our common stock. the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elect to be taxed as a reit. in addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying reit income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the code. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a reit from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. the ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in the interest of our stockholders. our board of directors determines our major policies, including policies and guidelines relating to our investments, acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, operations and distributions to our stockholders. our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 20 table of contents operational risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical records and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or in tape format. the adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents and tapes we store. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. as stored records become less active our service revenue growth and profitability may decline. our records management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. as a result, while we continue to experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records, thereby reducing their service activity levels. at the same time many of our costs related to records related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their information management expenditures. some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and adopting more aggressive destruction practices. if we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 21 table of contents governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, if we fail to protect our own information, including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states in the united states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached, and, in 2015, many states expanded the scope of their data breach notifications laws and shortened notification timelines. some states in the united states have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in addition, certain united states federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect our business. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the united states. for example, the 114th congress has considered and will likely consider legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. in europe, a new data protection regulation will likely come into effect in 2018 and will supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. the new regulation will enhance the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as iron mountain, that process data of residents of members of the european economic area and substantially increase penalties for violations. in addition, the european court of justice has invalidated a decision of the european commission that permitted our european affiliates and our european customers to transfer personal data to entities in the united states that are certified under the eu-us safe harbor framework. this decision, a failure of the european union and the united states to agree on a new safe-harbor framework, the new regulation and laws in other countries that restrict the export of personal data may result in more customers demanding local solutions, which would increase our it infrastructure, maintenance and support costs. the continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2015, we operated 1,046 records management, off-site data protection and fine art storage facilities worldwide, including 575 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 22 table of contents our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability under our dms and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. selling our services to the united states government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2015, we provided services in 36 countries outside the united states. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular, we are subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income, debt balances or leverage can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies. 23 table of contents we have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which operate in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international storage and information management services businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts (including the classification of our distributions as nonqualified ordinary dividends, qualified ordinary dividends or return of capital, as described more fully in "item 5. market registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" included in this annual report) may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe storms and hurricanes and our key facilities in florida and other coastal areas in particular are subject to this inherent risk. 24 table of contents damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our information technology and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. 25 table of contents risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2015, our total long-term debt was approximately $4.90 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit agreement (as defined below) and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make acquisitions and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our credit agreement will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by our direct and indirect wholly owned united states subsidiaries, that represent the substantial majority of our united states operations. 26 table of contents acquisition and expansion risks elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks. as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, including abos, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. for example, in 2013 we expanded our entry into the data center market by leasing wholesale and retail colocation space in our underground facility in pennsylvania, and in 2014 we opened our first regional data center in massachusetts, each of which required a significant capital commitment. many of these new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the united states. 27 table of contents we also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 74 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2015 related to cash and cash equivalents held in time deposits with four global banks, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million . as of december 31, 2015 , our cash and cash equivalents balance was $128.4 million , including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $18.6 million . interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2015 , we had $1,238.1 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.3%, and $3,665.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2015 , approximately 75% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 would have been reduced by approximately $10.5 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2015 . currency risk our international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real, australian dollar and the russian ruble. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our treasury centers in switzerland, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. 74 table of contents we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada and continental europe. ime has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in british pounds sterling under the gbp notes. similarly, canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and the cad notes. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. we utilized a portion of our previously outstanding 6 3 / 4 % notes and, subsequent to their redemption in october 2015, continue to utilize a portion of euro denominated borrowings by imi under the revolving credit facility, to effectively hedge our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in euros. we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % notes issued by imi and continue to designate a portion of our euro denominated borrowings by imi under the revolving credit facility, as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $3.3 million ($3.3 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, cumulative net gains of $17.1 million, net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. we have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in euros, british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2015, however, we had no forward contracts outstanding. in the future, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the maturity of any forward contract, we may enter into a new forward contract to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from any forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated forward contracts as hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2015, there was $22.7 million in net cash payments included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net losses in connection with forward contracts of $20.3 million in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2015 . as of december 31, 2015 , except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2015 functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $49.8 million.risk factors 12 risk factors" of this annual report. you should not rely upon forward-looking

backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or life cycle stage. we offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, has more than 230,000 customers in a variety of industries in 45 countries around the world as of december 31, 2016. we currently provide storage and information management services to commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services, entertainment and government organizations, including approximately 95% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2016, we employed more than 24,000 people. now in our 66th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996, at which time we operated fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of approximately $104.0 million. we are now a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with over 1,400 facilities (86.2 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. we are listed on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") and on the australian stock exchange ("asx"). we are a constituent of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index and the msci reit index and, as of december 31, 2016, we were number 730 on the fortune 1000. we have been organized and operating as a reit effective for our taxable year beginning january 1, 2014. our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our storage rental revenues and resulting storage net operating income. supported by consistent and predictable storage rental revenues, we generate durable, low-volatility growth. this fundamental financial characteristic provides stability throughout economic cycles. since may 2012, we have returned $3.0 billion of capital to stockholders including $1.9 billion in cash and $1.1 billion in our common stock. recall acquisition on may 2, 2016 (sydney, australia time), we completed the recall transaction. at the closing of the recall transaction, we paid approximately $331.8 million in cash and issued approximately 50.2 million shares of our common stock which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of april 29, 2016 (the last day of trading on the nyse prior to the closing of the recall transaction) of $36.53 per share, resulted in a total purchase price to recall shareholders of approximately $2,166.9 million. the durability of our business a significant amount of activity generated in the information management industry is the result of legislative requirements. to varying degrees across the world, organizations are required by law to create certain records and to retain them for a specified period of time. these laws may also impose more stringent requirements on personal information regarded as being sensitive, such as financial and medical information. as a third party provider, we assist customers to improve data security and establish programs to ensure compliance with their regulatory obligations. storage of information can be performed in-house by businesses (unvended) or outsourced, in whole or in part, to a third party provider (vended). we believe the in-house portion still represents a majority of the total global information management market, offering a substantial unvended opportunity even in developed geographic markets with lower rates of economic growth. 1 table of contents we believe that the creation of document-based information will be sustained, as "paperless" technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of computer backup media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. ultimately, we expect that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued growth in data as a result of enhanced data processing technologies; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. business strategy overview we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. our current strategy is focused on: (1) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, australia and western europe, primarily through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (2) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america and asia, primarily through acquisitions; and (3) continuing to identify, incubate and scale adjacent business opportunities ("abos") to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. in our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest profit growth. in our existing emerging markets, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. there are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. we also expect to invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. in our developed markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. we also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through abos. we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services and data management services. we have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs, increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience, thereby maintaining our strong customer retention rates and attracting new customers. our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions, pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses, developing adjacent businesses (organically and through acquisitions) and optimizing our real estate portfolio. we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services, based on our customers' evolving requirements. adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth from existing and new customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional records at a faster rate than old records are destroyed or permanently removed. the absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past five years, and we anticipate that this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth from existing customers is slightly declining, given the continued growth in our total records volume. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service. 2 table of contents our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets. our sales force is dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of related services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our united states and international marketing organizations and senior management. we have developed tailored marketing strategies to target customers in the healthcare, financial, insurance, legal, life sciences, energy, business services and federal vertical market segments. growth through acquisitions the storage and information management services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant consolidation in the industry. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. after 2004, our acquisition activity was reduced as we focused on integrating these recent transactions and diversifying the business. beginning again in 2012, we saw opportunities for attractive acquisitions in emerging markets and consolidation opportunities in more developed markets, and resumed acquisition activity. we believe this ongoing acquisition activity is due to opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. attractive acquisition opportunities, in north america and internationally, continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present good returns and good opportunities to create value for our stockholders. lastly, we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating these businesses. we have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the united states, canada, australia and western europe. given the relatively small size of most attractive acquisition targets in these markets, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. on may 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of recall for approximately $2,166.9 million. in connection with the recall transaction, we acquired the entirety of recall's global operations, including all facilities, vehicles, employees and customer assets (excluding certain operations of recall that we were required to divest subsequent to the closing of the recall transaction in accordance with agreements with regulatory authorities in the united states, canada, australia and the united kingdom). we believe the acquisition of recall accelerates our already successful growth strategy. after the recall transaction, with our broader footprint, stronger infrastructure, increased exposure to high growth emerging markets and small to mid-size enterprise customers, and increased economies of scale, we believe we will be well suited to address unmet document storage and information management needs around the globe. we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the united states, canada, australia and western europe. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. we expect that future acquisitions and investments in our emerging markets will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern europe, latin america and asia. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important to our emerging market acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations such that, as of december 31, 2016, we operated in 45 countries. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. our local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition, we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is generally to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. we now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our emerging market investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. 3 table of contents growth through abos abos, such as our data center and fine art storage businesses, are prospective business lines that we consider investing in to grow and diversify our business. we are seeking businesses with long-term, recurring revenue, preferably with storage rental attributes, which are consistent with, and will enhance, our reit structure. a dedicated team is focused on identifying and evaluating these opportunities. we have developed an innovation process that enables us to cautiously and effectively develop these abos to leverage our capabilities. if we are able to demonstrate success and meet return thresholds, we may acquire businesses to further accelerate our growth in the relevant abo. importantly, the abo process includes financial hurdles and decision gates to help us evaluate whether we scale or discontinue investments in these opportunities, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation. with respect to our data center business, we believe that the growth rate of critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. on december 1, 2015 we completed the acquisition of crozier fine arts ("crozier"), a storage, logistics and transportation business for high-value paintings, photographs and other types of art belonging to individual collectors, galleries and art museums. crozier is a leader in art storage and an industry advocate for worldwide standards. this acquisition builds upon our expertise in storing, protecting and managing high-value items and supports our strategy to leverage our real estate network to accelerate growth. in addition, in june 2016, we acquired the assets of fairfield fine arts ( fairfield ), an art storage and handling company. in connection with the fairfield acquisition, we acquired all of fairfield's customer relationships and its state-of-the-art 10,000 square foot storage facility in ridgefield, connecticut. the fine art storage industry is a growing, but fragmented, industry marked by increasing international interest and changes in purchasing habits by collectors and museums. the increase in contemporary art as a focus for collectors has caused a spike in storage needs, while the increase in auction turnover - the rate at which catalogs, collections and individual pieces are made available for auction - has heightened the need for transportation, shipping, and related services. taken together, we believe these factors have the fine art storage industry poised for significant growth. business characteristics we generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base around the globe and providing an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for the majority of our revenue growth. services are a complementary part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records ("information governance and digital solutions ") (formerly referred to as document management solutions), data restoration projects, the storage, assembly, reporting and delivery of customer marketing literature, or fulfillment services, consulting services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), technology escrow services, and recurring project revenues. secure storage our storage operations, our largest source of revenue, consist of providing non-dedicated storage rental space to our customers. non-dedicated space allows our customers to increase or decrease the volume of their physical storage over the life of the contract based on their storage needs, while also reducing their risk of loss in the event of natural disaster. given this non-dedicated space dynamic, the large portfolio of customer contracts, and the fact that no customer accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016, we assess the performance of our storage rental business predominantly by analyzing trends in segment-level storage rental volume and storage rental revenue. additionally, our storage operations include technology escrow services. records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. the secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs. storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security. 4 table of contents physical records storage physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. inactive physical records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer for long periods of time with limited activity. for some customers, we store individual files on an open shelf basis as these files are typically more active. physical records may also include critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film, fine art and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. we continue to identify additional areas of physical storage that fit with our core competencies in security and transportation, seeking to provide enterprise storage to businesses in much the same manner that self-storage companies serve consumers. physical records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for these vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. electronic records storage electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. electronic storage consists of (i) storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans; (ii) server and computer backup services; (iii) digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets; and (iv) storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different from the storage of physical records. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover their data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to offsite locations on a regular basis and to store multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. we expect continued increase in demand for computer media backup, as it provides off-line storage or storage that is not connected to the internet and provides superior protection against data breaches and hacks. in addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is an internet-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. service offerings complementary to any records management program is the handling and transportation and the eventual destruction of records upon the expiration of retention periods. these activities are accomplished through our complementary service and courier operations. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2016, our courier fleet consisted of approximately 4,500 owned or leased vehicles. our other services include information destruction services (primarily secure shredding)("destruction"), information governance and digital solutions, compliant records management and consulting services, and other ancillary services. 5 table of contents information destruction services our destruction services consist primarily of (1) secure shredding operations which typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide and (2) secure information technology asset destruction. in addition, secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services by completing the lifecycle of a record and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the united states, canada, australia, and latin america. information governance and digital solutions the focus of our information governance and digital solutions business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our information governance and digital solutions services complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that complement and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our information governance and digital solutions services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their edm solutions. industry tailored services we offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as healthcare, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. for example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. in addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. our industry tailored services include health information management solutions, entertainment services and energy data services. other ancillary services other services we provide include recurring project work, which involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both offsite at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at a customer's premises. other services that we provide include fulfillment services and compliant records management and consulting services. 6

corporate and other business segment primarily consists of our data center and fine art storage businesses in the united states, the primary product offerings of our adjacent businesses operating segment, as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. these costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. our corporate and other business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. 7 table of contents our business fundamentals our business fundamentals are based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. we generate attractive returns from our differentiated storage rental business model because our occupancy costs, whether in a leased or owned building, are incurred per square foot while our storage revenue is generally earned per cubic foot. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting profitability allows us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business fundamentals consist of: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. this stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and profitability. a customer is allocated a certain amount of storage space in our storage facilities but is not allocated a dedicated building or space in a particular building. in practice, we can, and sometimes will, for a variety of reasons, move records from one facility and into another facility. in order to track net move-in and move-out activity of customer materials, as well as to assess the optimization of our real estate portfolio, we regularly assess the utilization of our overall real estate portfolio. on a per building basis, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the entire building assuming it was fully racked ("total building utilization"). additionally, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the racking that has been installed ("total racking utilization"). as of december 31, 2016, our total building utilization and total racking utilization were approximately 92% and 85%, respectively, for our records management business and our total building utilization and total racking utilization, excluding the impact of the recall transaction, were approximately 82% and 71%, respectively, for our data management business. the total building utilization and total racking utilization for our data management business as of december 31, 2016 excludes the impact of the recall transaction, as recall's unit of measurement for computer media is not consistent with ours. as part of the integration of recall, we are in the process of converting recall's unit of measurement for computer media to be consistent with ours to enable us to report both total building utilization and total racking utilization, including recall, for our data management business. we occasionally offer inducements to our customers in order to generate new business opportunities. such inducements most commonly come in the form of providing free intake costs to transport a customer's records to one of our facilities, including labor and transportation costs ("move costs"), or payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate the customer's existing contract with that vendor, or direct payments to a customer ("permanent withdrawal fees"). we capitalize move costs and permanent withdrawal fees (collectively, "customer inducements") as customer acquisition costs. historically non-cyclical storage rental business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns. we believe the durability of our storage rental business is driven by a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, as well as customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. the absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past five years, and we anticipate this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth is slightly declining, given the continued growth in the total records volume. total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 4%, 2% and 26% on a global basis for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. the total net volume growth in 2016 was primarily driven by the impact of the recall transaction. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2016, we had more than 230,000 customers in a variety of industries in 45 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services, entertainment and government organizations, including approximately 95% of the fortune 1000. no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. for each of the three years 2014 through 2016, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was approximately 2%. 8 table of contents capital allocation. all the characteristics of our business noted above support the durability of our cash flows, which in turn support our dividends and a portion of our investments. absent a large acquisition or significant investments in real estate, we typically generate cash flows to support our dividends, maintain our operations and infrastructure and invest in core growth opportunities. we plan on funding acquisitions, abo investments and real estate investments primarily through incremental borrowings, proceeds from real estate sales and/or proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities, dependent on market conditions. below are descriptions of the major types of investments and other capital expenditures that we have made in recent years or that we are likely to consider in 2017: real estate: real estate assets that support core business growth primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies, or real estate investment. real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures, or real estate maintenance. non-real estate: non-real estate assets that either (i) support the growth of our business, and/or increase our profitability, such as customer-inventory technology systems, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) are directly related to the development of core products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhance our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements, or non-real estate investment. non-real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements, or non-real estate maintenance. the following table presents our capital spend for 2014, 2015 and 2016 organized by the type of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (in thousands) 2014 2015 2016 real estate: investment $ 199,663 $ 170,742 $ 203,778 maintenance 57,574 52,826 63,543 total real estate capital spend 257,237

(on cash basis) $ 361,924 $ 290,249 $ 328,603 competition we are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 45 countries as of december 31, 2016. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. 9 table of contents we also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. the physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. to date, none of the alternative technologies has replaced physical documents as the primary means for storing information. we continue to provide, primarily through partnerships, additional services such as online backup, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high-quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. employees as of december 31, 2016, we employed more than 8,500 employees in the united states and more than 15,500 employees outside of the united states. at december 31, 2016, approximately 700 employees were represented by unions in north america (in california, illinois, georgia, new jersey and pennsylvania and three provinces in canada) and approximately 3,800 employees were represented by unions in latin america (in argentina, brazil and chile). all union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. certain unionized employees in california receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance and contractual limitations on liability for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability for damages regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot, and our liability for information governance and digital solutions, destruction and other services unrelated to records stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as a larger percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions (including the customer contracts assumed in the recall transaction) make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. 10 table of contents environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties, including those acquired in the recall transaction and other acquisitions we have completed. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental cost and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. corporate responsibility we are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiative. our corporate responsibility

under the heading "corporate governance." 11 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. we have elected to be taxed as a reit since our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply. qualification for taxation as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates; and we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced. as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax. we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions, and, to achieve maximum tax efficiency and retain cash to allow us to make selective discretionary investments, we currently anticipate our typical regular quarterly distributions will be based on a payment of approximately 100% of our reit taxable income; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code. 12 table of contents we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks relating to our indebtedness." whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of any potential issuances of equity securities, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. in addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a reit. as a result, we may be required to liquidate or to forego our pursuit of otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. at any time, the federal income tax laws governing reits, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the united states internal revenue service (the "irs"), the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing. we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. beginning in our 2018 taxable year, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss. 13 table of contents as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss. our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability. in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements. our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. our operations include an extensive use of trss, which has increased since our acquisition of recall. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. beginning with our 2018 taxable year, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. a reit generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income to its stockholders. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit. our information management services businesses and several of our international operations are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. 14 table of contents we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate (currently 35%) on gain recognized from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2014, or (ii) an asset that we hold in one of our qualified reit subsidiaries ("qrss") following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this 35% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset (e.g., january 1, 2014 in the case of reit assets we held at the time of our reit conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. in addition, depreciation recapture income that we expect to recognize in connection with the recall transaction as a result of accounting method changes that we will make will be fully subject to this 35% tax. in addition, the irs and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable periods prior to january 1, 2014 (our "pre-reit period"), in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. moreover, any increase in taxable income during our pre-reit period will likely result in an increase in pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-united states operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future taxable income in the trss. distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates. qualifying distributions payable by corporations to individuals, trusts and estates that are united states stockholders are currently eligible for preferential federal income tax rates. distributions payable by reits, in contrast, generally do not qualify for these preferential rates. the preferential rates applicable to regular corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-reit corporations that pay distributions, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our common stock. 15 table of contents the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elect to be taxed as a reit. in addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying reit income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the code. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a reit from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. the ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in the interest of our stockholders. our board of directors determines our major policies, including policies and guidelines relating to our investments, acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, operations and distributions to our stockholders. our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 16 table of contents operational risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical records and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the paper documents or tapes we store become less active and more archival. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or as tapes, or that the paper documents or tapes they do store with us will require our storage related services at the same levels as they have in the past. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. as stored records and tapes become less active our service revenue growth and profitability may decline. our records management and data protection service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records and tapes are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years, and we believe this trend has been accelerating. as a result, while we continue to experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records and rotate tapes, thereby reducing their service activity levels. at the same time many of our costs related to records and tape related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service activity, our operating results could be adversely affected. changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their information management expenditures. some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and adopting more aggressive destruction practices. if we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, if we fail to protect our own information, including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states in the united states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached, and, over the past few years, many states expanded the scope of their data breach notifications laws and shortened notification timelines. some states in the united states have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in addition, certain united states federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to comply with any such programs may adversely affect our business. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the united states. for example, congress has considered, and will likely consider again, legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. 17 table of contents also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. in europe, a new data protection regulation will likely come into effect in may 2018 and will supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. the new regulation will enhance the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as us, that process data of residents of members of the european economic area and substantially increase penalties for violations. in addition, the european court of justice has invalidated a decision of the european commission that permitted our european affiliates and our european customers to transfer personal data to entities in the united states that are certified under the european union - united states safe harbor framework. this decision, a failure of the european union and the united states to agree on a new safe-harbor framework and the new regulation and laws in other countries that restrict the export of personal data may result in more customers demanding local solutions, which would increase our information technology infrastructure, maintenance and support costs. the continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our information technology and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or other disruptions. moreover, our ability to integrate recall's business and other businesses we acquire may challenge our ability to prevent such security breaches. from time to time, we may also outsource certain information technology and back office support services to third parties, which may subject our information technology and other sensitive information to additional risk. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2016, we operated 1,290 records management, off-site data protection and fine art storage facilities worldwide, including 615 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. a significant aspect of the integration of recall with our business is the process of making certain investments in the acquired recall facilities to conform such facilities to our standards of operations. this process is complex and time-consuming. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 18 table of contents our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage (such as per cubic foot) and our liability for information governance and digital solutions, destruction and other services unrelated to records stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as a large percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions (including the customer contracts assumed in the recall transaction) make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2016, we provided services in 44 countries outside the united states. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular, we are subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties and changes in the global political climate which may impose restrictions on global operations; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income, debt balances or leverage can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies. our exposure to the risk from international operations was increased by the recall acquisition, as recall's foreign operations made up a more significant portion of its worldwide revenue than our foreign operations did prior to the recall transaction. consequently, our international operations now account for a more significant portion of our overall operations than they did before the recall acquisition. 19 table of contents we have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which operate in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international storage and information management services businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts (including the classification of our distributions as nonqualified ordinary dividends, qualified ordinary dividends or return of capital, as described more fully in "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" included in this annual report) may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. selling our services to the united states government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties, including those acquired in the recall transaction and other acquisitions we have completed. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. 20 table of contents unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and our key facilities worldwide are subject to this inherent risk. damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. as a result, significant declines in the cost of paper may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. 21 table of contents risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2016, our total long-term debt was approximately $6.3 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; inability to pursue strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and expansion into adjacent businesses; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit agreement (as defined in note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make acquisitions and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our credit agreement will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by our direct and indirect 100% owned united states subsidiaries, that represent the substantial majority of our united states operations. 22 table of contents acquisition and expansion risks elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks. as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, including abos, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. for example, in recent years, we have expanded our entry into the data center and fine art storage businesses. our data center expansion in particular requires significant capital commitments and includes other costs associated with the development of real estate to support this business. many of these new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. we also face competition from other companies in our efforts to grow our adjacent businesses, some of which possess substantial financial and other resources. as a result, we may be unable to acquire, or may pay a significant purchase price for, adjacent businesses that support our strategic growth plan. failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. for example, the success of our acquisition of recall will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining recall's businesses with ours. to realize these anticipated benefits, we must be able to successfully integrate our business and recall's and this integration is complex and time-consuming. while we are progressing with the integration, we still may encounter challenges in the integration process including the following: challenges and difficulties associated with managing our larger, more complex, company; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two businesses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by integrating the entities' operations. in addition, our integration with recall may pose special risks, including asset write-offs or restructuring charges and unanticipated costs. further, our integration with recall will subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at recall or may arise in connection with the consummation of the recall transaction, some of which may be unknown. although we and our advisors conducted due diligence on the operations of recall, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of recall. these liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the recall transaction not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies, including recall. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations. 23 table of contents our net proceeds from the divestments may be lower than expected and we may be subject to liabilities as a result of provisions in the sale agreements governing the divestments. the terms of the sale agreements governing the divestments (as defined in note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) in the united states, canada and australia provide for post-closing adjustments to the purchase prices. in addition, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to the buyers following the completion of the divestments. as a result, the purchase prices for the divestments may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the sale agreements and the costs we will incur providing post-closing transition services as required under our sale agreements may exceed the amounts we have estimated. as such, the expected net proceeds of the divestments are uncertain and the actual net proceeds we receive from the divestments may be less than the net proceeds expected by us and the transition services costs may exceed our estimates. furthermore, in the sale agreements governing the divestments, we have made certain representations and warranties and are bound by certain covenants following the closings. any breach of such terms may subject us to liabilities in accordance with the terms of the sale agreements. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region, africa and the middle east to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate. a changing global political climate may impose restrictions on our ability to expand internationally. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the united states. we also compete with other storage and information management services providers as well as other entities for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 24 table of contents we have guaranteed certain obligations of recall to brambles relating to brambles' prior demerger transaction. on december 18, 2013, brambles limited, an australian corporation ("brambles"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of recall to brambles' shareholders (the demerger ). prior to and in connection with the demerger, brambles spun off certain of its united states and canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to recall. such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under united states and canadian tax laws, respectively, and brambles obtained rulings from the irs (with respect to the united states spin-off) and the canada revenue agency (with respect to the canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. however, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such united states subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such united states subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off. in connection with the demerger, recall agreed to indemnify brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by recall (e.g., an acquisition of recall shares) resulted in the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for united states or canadian tax purposes, respectively. in addition, recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the united states spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin-offs failing to be tax-free under united states federal income tax law or canadian tax law, respectively. recall has obtained such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by recall and us. such opinions do not affect recall's obligation to indemnify brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs. we have guaranteed the foregoing indemnification obligations of recall. consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that the recall transaction is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off, respectively. however, if the irs or the canadian revenue agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 73 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including time deposits) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2016 related to cash and cash equivalents held in time deposits with six global banks, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million . as of december 31, 2016 , our cash and cash equivalents balance was $236.5 million , including time deposits amounting to $22.2 million . interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2016 , we had $1,694.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 3.6%, and $4,624.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2016 , approximately 73% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 would have been reduced by approximately $13.7 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2016 . currency risk our international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real and the australian dollar. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our treasury centers in europe, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada, australia, and continental europe. ime has financed a portion of its capital needs through the issuance in british pounds sterling of the gbp notes. our australian business has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in australian dollars under the aud term loan. similarly, canada company has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and through the issuance of the cad notes. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. we utilize a portion of euro denominated borrowings by imi under the revolving credit facility to effectively hedge our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in euros. we designate a portion of our euro denominated borrowings by imi under the revolving credit facility as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $1.1 million ($1.1 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, cumulative net gains of $18.2 million , net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. 73 table of contents historically, we have entered into forward contracts to hedge our exposures in euros, british pounds sterling and australian dollars. during 2016, however, we had no forward contracts outstanding. in the future, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the maturity of any forward contract, we may enter into a new forward contract to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from any forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated forward contracts as hedges. as of december 31, 2016 , except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2016 functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $196.6 million.risk

contents item 1. business. business overview we store records, primarily physical records and data backup media, provide colocation and wholesale data center space, and provide information management and data center solutions that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, facilitate corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information and information technology ("it") infrastructure for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or life cycle stage. we offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. we provide data center facilities to protect digital information and ensure the continued operation of our customers' it infrastructures, with secure and reliable colocation and wholesale options. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, has more than 225,000 customers in a variety of industries in 53 countries around the world as of december 31, 2017. we currently serve customers across an array of market verticals - commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, business services, entertainment and government organizations, including approximately 95% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2017, we employed more than 24,000 people. now in our 67th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996, at which time we operated fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of approximately $104.0 million. we are now a global enterprise providing storage, data center space and a broad range of related records and information management and data center solutions, as well as entertainment, arts and media storage and services, to customers in markets around the world with over 1,400 facilities (87.5 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. we are listed on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") and on the australian stock exchange ("asx"). we are a constituent of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index and the msci reit index and, as of december 31, 2017, we were number 729 on the fortune 1000. we have been organized and have operated as a reit beginning with our taxable year ended december 31, 2014. our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our storage rental revenues and resulting storage net operating income. supported by consistent and predictable storage rental revenues, we generate durable, low-volatility growth. recall acquisition on may 2, 2016 (sydney, australia time), we completed the recall transaction. we purchased recall, a multi-national records and information management company for approximately $2.2 billion, comprising of $331.8 million in cash and approximately 50.2 million shares of our common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as of april 29, 2016 (the last day of trading on the nyse prior to the closing of the recall transaction) of $36.53 per share. the durability of our business a significant amount of activity generated in the information management industry is the result of legislative requirements. to varying degrees across the world, organizations are required by law to create certain records and to retain them for a specified period of time. these laws may also impose more stringent requirements on personal information regarded as being sensitive, such as financial and medical information. as a third party provider, we assist customers to improve data security and establish programs to ensure compliance with their regulatory obligations. storage of information can be performed in-house by businesses or governments (unvended) or it can be outsourced, in whole or in part, to a third party provider (vended). we believe the in-house portion still represents a majority of the total global information management market, offering a substantial unvended opportunity even in developed geographic markets with lower rates of economic growth. 1 table of contents we believe that the creation of document-based information will be sustained, as "paperless" technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies and have also led to increased demand for electronic records storage and services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of computer backup media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. we expect that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) requirements to support current and possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued growth in data as a result of enhanced data processing technologies; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster; and (8) the opportunity for companies to monetize the value that may reside in stored data and information for new commercial purposes. business strategy overview we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by organic growth and acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. our growth strategy is focused on: (1) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, australia and western europe, primarily through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (2) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america, africa and asia, primarily through acquisitions; and (3) continuing to identify, incubate and scale adjacent business opportunities ("abos") to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. in our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest profit growth. in our existing emerging markets, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. we have made significant progress through acquisitions and organic growth in scaling our data center business, which began as an abo but now has achieved such a size that we no longer consider it an abo. in addition, we continue to pursue other businesses adjacent to our core such as entertainment, fine art and consumer storage and services. storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. there are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. we also expect to invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. in our developed markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. we also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through data centers and abos. we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services, data management services and archival cloud storage for digital records. we have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs, increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience, thereby maintaining our strong customer retention rates and attracting new customers. our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions, pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses, developing adjacent businesses (organically and through acquisitions) and optimizing our real estate portfolio. we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services, based on our customers' evolving requirements. adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. 2 table of contents growth from existing and new customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional records at a faster rate than old records are destroyed or permanently removed. we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service and a variety of services tied to records management and information governance. while the rate of growth of new physical records from existing customers in our more mature markets has been declining, we seek to maintain revenue growth from existing customers through sales of services, further penetration of unvended customers in the mid-market and united states federal government vertical market segments and revenue management programs. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets. our sales force is dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of related service and product offerings. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our united states and international marketing organizations and senior management. we have developed tailored marketing strategies to target customers in the healthcare, financial, insurance, legal, life sciences, energy, business services and united states federal government vertical market segments. growth through acquisitions in our core business the storage and information management services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant consolidation in the industry. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. after 2004, our acquisition activity was reduced as we focused on integrating those transactions and diversifying the business. beginning again in 2012, we saw opportunities for attractive acquisitions in emerging markets and consolidation opportunities in more developed markets, and resumed acquisition activity. we believe this ongoing acquisition activity is due to opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. attractive acquisition opportunities, in north america and internationally, continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of businesses we believe present good returns and good opportunities to create value for our stockholders. lastly, we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating these businesses. we have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the united states, canada, australia and western europe. given the relatively small size of most attractive acquisition targets in these markets, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. on may 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of recall for approximately $2,166.9 million. in connection with the recall transaction, we acquired the entirety of recall's global operations, including all facilities, vehicles, employees and customer assets (excluding certain operations of recall that we were required to divest subsequent to the closing of the recall transaction in accordance with agreements with regulatory authorities in the united states, canada and the united kingdom). we believe the acquisition of recall accelerates our growth strategy. after the recall transaction, with our broader footprint, stronger infrastructure, increased exposure to high growth emerging markets and small to mid-size enterprise customers, and increased economies of scale, we believe we are well suited to address unmet document storage and information management needs around the globe. we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the united states, canada, australia and western europe. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. we expect that future acquisitions and investments in our emerging markets will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern europe, latin america and asia. 3 table of contents the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important to our emerging markets acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations such that, as of december 31, 2017, we operated in 53 countries. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments generally with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. our local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with their local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition, we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is generally to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. we own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our emerging market investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. growth of our data center business with the rapid acceleration of growth in digital data and use of cloud storage, highly regulated companies and public sector organizations are selecting third-party providers such as us to host their data center infrastructure. the primary benefits of outsourcing include the ability to make more efficient use of real estate and the benefits of professional management. in addition, data center outsourcing provides improved connectivity, increased operational efficiency, predictable cost structure, consumption-based pricing, and flexibility with access to seamless expansion. we have been providing customers, primarily in highly regulated industries, with colocation and wholesale data center space and solutions for more than 15 years. we seek to differentiate ourselves from the competition due to our experience with highly regulated industries, chief compliance officers and customers who are particularly focused on data security and mitigating risk. our commitment to and reputation for highly secure operations was a major driver behind our agreement announced in october 2017 to acquire two data centers from credit suisse in london and singapore for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $100.0 million (see note 6 to notes to financial consolidated statements included in this annual report). we intend to continue to expand our data center capabilities to service customers in multiple geographies, focused on the top 20 global data center markets based on space absorption. we expect to grow through organic expansion within our existing footprint, greenfield development in the largest united states markets such as our campus in manassas, virginia, and targeted acquisitions of properties with customer profiles that closely mirror our own, such as the acquisition of fortrust, a denver based data center provider, in september 2017 for a total aggregate purchase price of approximately $137.5 million. on december 11, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire the united states operations of io data centers, llc ( iodc ), a leading data center colocation space and solutions provider based in phoenix, arizona, including the land and buildings associated with four state-of-the-art data centers in phoenix and scottsdale, arizona, edison, new jersey, and columbus, ohio, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $1,315.0 million (the initial iodc consideration ), plus up to $60.0 million of additional proceeds (including (i) $25.0 million of contingent consideration (the iodc contingent consideration ) and (ii) $35.0 million of contingent payments associated with the execution of future customer contracts), subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the purchase agreement (the iodc transaction ). on january 10, 2018, we completed the iodc transaction. at the closing of the iodc transaction, we paid approximately $1,340.0 million of total consideration, consisting of the initial iodc consideration and the full amount of the iodc contingent consideration. we financed the consideration for the iodc transaction with the proceeds from the equity offering, the over-allotment option and the issuance of the 5 % notes (each as defined in notes 4 and 13 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report). the existing data center space in the four owned facilities totals 728,000 square feet, providing 62 megawatts ("mw") of capacity with expansion potential of an additional 77 mw in arizona and new jersey. this acquisition marks a transformative step toward addressing our customers' data center needs by dramatically expanding our platform and capabilities. it positions us as a leading data center company with an expanded platform and ability to offer colocation space in certain leading markets. with this transaction and following the closing of the aforementioned credit suisse acquisition expected in early 2018, our data center portfolio will total more than 90 mw of existing capacity, with an additional 26 mw of capacity currently under construction and planned and future expansion potential of another 135 mw. 4 table of contents growth through abos abos, which currently primarily consist of our entertainment and fine art storage and services businesses, include business lines that we consider investing in to grow and diversify our business. we are seeking businesses with long-term, recurring revenues, preferably with storage rental attributes, which are consistent with, and will enhance, our reit structure. a dedicated team is focused on identifying and evaluating these opportunities. if we are able to demonstrate success and meet return thresholds, we may acquire businesses to further accelerate our growth in the relevant abo. importantly, the abo process includes financial hurdles and decision gates to help us evaluate whether we scale or discontinue investments in these opportunities, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation. we have been in the entertainment storage and services business for a number of years, providing storage and solutions to entertainment and media companies in north america. entertainment and media companies around the globe require specialized storage facilities and solutions for protecting and preserving their intellectual property ("ip") while maintaining accessibility with changing technology and uses. essential to those needs are secure, climate-controlled vaults for physical media preservation (art, film and audio/video tape) as well as a digital environment capable of protecting that ip from hackers and data loss. having a single provider - the physical and digital storage, as well as the capabilities to transform content to new media formats for monetization and longer-term preservation - provides chain-of-custody for these companies. we are well positioned to meet these customer needs. on december 1, 2015 we completed the acquisition of crozier fine arts ("crozier"), a storage, logistics and transportation business for high-value paintings, photographs and other types of art belonging to individual collectors, galleries and art museums. crozier is a leader in art storage and an industry advocate for worldwide standards. this acquisition builds upon our expertise in storing, protecting and managing high-value items and supports our strategy to leverage our real estate network to accelerate growth. in addition, since our acquisition of crozier, we have expanded our fine arts storage business by acquiring the assets of two art storage and handling companies in the united states: fairfield fine arts in ridgefield, connecticut and cirkers brooklyn in brooklyn, new york. we believe the fine art storage industry is a growing, but fragmented, industry marked by increasing international interest and changes in purchasing habits by collectors and museums. we believe the increase in contemporary art as a focus for collectors has caused a spike in storage needs, while the increase in auction turnover - the rate at which catalogs, collections and individual pieces are made available for auction - has heightened the need for transportation, shipping, and related services. taken together, we believe these factors will result in continued growth of the fine art storage industry. on september 29, 2017, we completed the acquisition of bonded services of america, inc. and bonded services acquisition, ltd. (together, "bonded"), providers of media asset storage and management services for global entertainment and media companies, for approximately 62.0 million british pounds sterling (or approximately $83.0 million, based upon the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the united states dollar on the closing date of the acquisition of bonded), subject to customary adjustments. bonded provides storage and services for media content preservation, management and distribution, including fine art vaults and shipping; logistics and distribution; supply chain; and related services for high value physical and digital assets, including works of art, film, audio and video. bonded managed more than 10 million of these assets for its 2,000 clients worldwide, with offices in the united states, canada, the united kingdom, france, the netherlands and hong kong, capable of providing in-house digital services that help media and entertainment companies extend their content across digital platforms. this acquisition scales our existing entertainment storage and services business and broadens our geographic footprint. 5 table of contents business characteristics we generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base around the globe and providing an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for the majority of our revenue growth. services are a complementary part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records ("information governance and digital solutions"), data restoration projects, the storage, assembly, reporting and delivery of customer marketing literature, or fulfillment services ("fulfillment services"), consulting services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), technology escrow services, and recurring project revenues. secure storage our storage operations, our largest source of revenue, consist of providing non-dedicated storage rental space to our customers. non-dedicated space allows our customers to increase or decrease the volume of their physical storage over the life of the contract based on their storage needs, while also reducing their risk of loss in the event of natural disaster. given this non-dedicated space dynamic, the large portfolio of customer contracts, and the fact that no customer accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017, we assess the performance of our storage rental business predominantly by analyzing trends in segment-level storage rental volume and storage rental revenue. additionally, our storage operations include technology escrow services. records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. the secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs. storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security. physical records storage physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. inactive physical records are typically stored for long periods of time with limited activity in cartons packed by the customer. for some customers, we store individual files on an open shelf basis as these files are typically more active. physical records may also include critical or irreplaceable data such as film, fine art and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. we continue to identify additional areas of physical storage that fit with our core competencies in security and transportation, seeking to provide enterprise storage to businesses in much the same manner that self-storage companies serve consumers. physical records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for these vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. electronic records storage electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature and data backup and storage on our proprietary cloud. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. electronic storage consists of (i) storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans; (ii) server and computer backup services; (iii) digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets; and (iv) storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. 6 table of contents we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different from the storage of physical records. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover their data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to offsite locations on a regular basis and to store multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. we expect continued increase in demand for computer media backup, as it provides off-line storage or storage that is not connected to the internet and provides superior protection against data breaches and hacks. in addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is an internet-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. in 2017, we launched iron mountain iron cloud. iron cloud is our enterprise-class cloud storage platform and services offering for comprehensive data protection, preservation, restoration and recovery. with iron cloud, organizations can deploy a hybrid data management strategy with the benefits of a cloud service, but with predictable cost models and integrated security that scales for enterprises of all sizes, as well as data accessibility through a self-service portal providing transparency and control for efficient storage operations. iron cloud provides on demand block and object storage, accessible through secure connectivity from the enterprise to iron mountain's network of secure data centers. iron cloud addresses the critical stages of enterprise data management with advanced orchestration and automation for managing data sprawl, while securing data in motion and at rest and catering to the unique security and operational needs of medical imaging, surveillance video and other specialty media. cloud services are increasingly becoming an integral part of many organizations' it and data environments. as companies continue to transform their businesses with technology, they are facing data growth and complex challenges of determining what data to retain, where to store it and how to manage data access. seeking to address these challenges, organizations are systematically replacing the practice of retaining data on premises and opting for hybrid models that require reliable and secure cloud storage. as a cloud storage platform for end-to-end data management, iron cloud addresses where to store data and the challenges of protecting, preserving and accessing data to address business requirements. our approach to data management also enables organizations to manage risk by complying with industry standards and implementing advanced schemes to protect against cyberattacks. service offerings complementary to any records management program is the handling and transportation and the eventual destruction of records upon the expiration of retention periods. these activities are accomplished through our complementary service and courier operations. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2017, our courier fleet consisted of approximately 4,700 owned or leased vehicles. our other services include information destruction services (primarily secure shredding) ("destruction"), information governance and digital solutions, compliant records management and consulting services, and other ancillary services. information destruction services our destruction services consist primarily of (1) secure shredding operations which typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide and (2) secure it asset destruction. in addition, secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services by completing the lifecycle of a record and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the united states, canada, australia, and latin america. 7 table of contents information governance and digital solutions the focus of our information governance and digital solutions business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our information governance and digital solutions offerings complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that complement and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our information governance and digital solutions offerings provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their edm solutions. industry tailored services we offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as healthcare, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. for example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. in addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. our industry tailored services include health information management solutions, entertainment services and energy data services. other ancillary services other services we provide include recurring project work, such as the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both offsite at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at a customer's premises. other services that we provide include fulfillment services and compliant records management and consulting services. business segments our north american records and information management business, north american data management business, western european business, other international business and global data center business segments offer

our global data center segment provides data center facilities to protect mission-critical assets and ensure the continued operation of our customers' it infrastructures, with secure and reliable colocation and wholesale options. as of december 31, 2017, we had data center operations in five markets in the united states including: denver, colorado; kansas city, missouri; boston, massachusetts; boyers, pennsylvania; and manassas, virginia and had binding agreements to acquire data center operations in arizona, new jersey and ohio as well as london and singapore. corporate and other business our corporate and other business segment primarily consists of the storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types and digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients ( entertainment services ), throughout the united states, canada, france, hong kong, the netherlands and the united kingdom, as well as our fine art storage businesses and consumer storage businesses in the united states. these businesses represent the primary product offerings of our adjacent businesses operating segment. additionally, our corporate and other business segment includes costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and it, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. these costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. our corporate and other business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. 9 table of contents our business fundamentals our business fundamentals are based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. we generate attractive returns from our differentiated storage rental business model because our occupancy costs, whether in a leased or owned building, are incurred per square foot while our storage revenue is generally earned per cubic foot. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting profitability allows us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business fundamentals consist of: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. this storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for our service revenues and increases in profitability. a customer is allocated a certain amount of storage space in our storage facilities but is not allocated a dedicated building or space in a particular building. in practice, we can, and sometimes will, for a variety of reasons, move records from one facility and into another facility. in order to track net move-in and move-out activity of customer materials, as well as to assess the optimization of our real estate portfolio, we regularly assess the utilization of our overall real estate portfolio. on a per building basis, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the entire building assuming it was fully racked ("total building utilization"). additionally, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the racking that has been installed ("total racking utilization"). we occasionally offer inducements to our customers in order to generate new business opportunities. such inducements most commonly come in the form of providing free intake costs to transport a customer's records to one of our facilities, including labor and transportation costs ("move costs"), or payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate the customer's existing contract with that vendor, or direct payments to a customer ("permanent withdrawal fees"). we capitalize move costs and permanent withdrawal fees (collectively, "customer inducements") as customer acquisition costs. historically non-cyclical storage rental business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns. we believe the durability of our storage rental business is driven by a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth of incoming volume from our existing customers, as well as customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. on a global basis, the absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past five years, and we anticipate this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth is slightly declining, given the continued growth in the total records volume. total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 2%, 26% and 2% on a global basis for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. the total net volume growth in 2016 was primarily driven by the impact of the recall transaction. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2017, we had more than 225,000 customers in a variety of industries in 53 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services, entertainment and government organizations, including approximately 95% of the fortune 1000. no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. for each of the three years 2015 through 2017, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was approximately 2%. 10 table of contents capital allocation. all the characteristics of our business noted above support the durability of our cash flows, which in turn support our dividends and a portion of our investments. absent a large acquisition or significant investments in real estate, we typically generate cash flows to support our dividends, maintain our operations and infrastructure and invest in core growth opportunities. we plan on funding acquisitions, data center expansion, abo investments and real estate investments primarily through incremental borrowings, proceeds from real estate sales and/or proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities (including our at the market (atm) equity program (as defined below), dependent on market conditions. we made two changes to our capital expenditure categories in 2017. we now separately identify two additional capital expenditure categories, innovation and growth investment capital spend (previously included within non-real estate investment ) and data center capital spend (previously primarily included in real estate investment and non-real estate investment ). we have reclassified the categorization of our prior year capital expenditures to conform with our current presentation. below are descriptions of the major types of investments and other capital expenditures that we have made in recent years or that we are likely to consider in 2018: real estate: investment: real estate assets that support core business growth primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies, or real estate investment. maintenance: real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures, or real estate maintenance. non-real estate: investment: non-real estate assets that either (i) support the growth of our business, and/or increase our profitability, such as customer-inventory technology systems, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) are directly related to the development of core products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhance our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements, or non-real estate investment. maintenance: non-real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. this category also includes capital to support initiatives such as sales and marketing and it projects to support infrastructure requirements, or non-real estate maintenance. data center investment and maintenance: defined as capital expenditures that support data center business growth, primarily related to investments in new construction of data center facilities (including the acquisition of land and development of facilities) or capacity expansion in existing buildings, as well as capital expenditures that are expected to support incremental improvements to our data center business, through either increasing revenue, improving operating efficiency, or extending the useful life of our real estate operating assets. this also includes capital expenditures necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or maintenance of assets, as well as for the re-configuration of existing assets. innovation and growth investment: defined as discretionary capital expenditures in significant new products and services in new, existing or adjacent business opportunities. 11 table of contents the following table presents our capital spend for 2015, 2016 and 2017 organized by the type of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (in thousands) 2015 2016 2017 real estate: investment $ 151,695 $ 133,079 $ 139,822 maintenance 52,826 63,543 77,660 total real estate capital spend 204,521 196,622 217,482 non-real

_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) the amount at december 31, 2017 includes approximately $66,800 related to a capital lease associated with our data center in manassas, virginia. competition we are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 53 countries as of december 31, 2017. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. we compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. the physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that competition for records and information customers is based on price, reputation and reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in these areas. we also compete with numerous data center developers, owners and operators, many of whom own properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our facilities are located. we believe that competition for data center customers is based on available power, security considerations, location, connectivity and rental rates, and we believe we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. while storage of physical documents continues to grow, we continue to provide, primarily through partnerships, additional services such as online backup, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high-quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. employees as of december 31, 2017, we employed more than 8,400 employees in the united states and more than 15,600 employees outside of the united states. at december 31, 2017, approximately 700 employees were represented by unions in north america (in california, illinois, georgia, new jersey and pennsylvania and three provinces in canada) and approximately 3,600 employees were represented by unions in latin america (in argentina, brazil and chile). 12 table of contents all union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. certain unionized employees in california receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance and contractual limitations on liability for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability for damages regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot, and our liability for data center, information governance and digital solutions, destruction and other services unrelated to records stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as a larger percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties, including those acquired in acquisitions we have completed. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental cost and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. 13 table of contents corporate responsibility we are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiative. our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for our efforts in the community, our environment, and for our people. we are a trusted partner to approximately 95% of the fortune 1000. we are a member of the ftse4 good index, dow jones sustainability index, msci world esg index, msci acwi esg index and msci usa imi esg index, each of which include companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. a copy of our corporate responsibility report is available on the "about us" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate social responsibility." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "investors" section on our website, we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, finance, nominating and governance, and risk and safety committees are available on the "investors" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." 14 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. operational risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical records and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the paper documents or tapes we store become less active and more archival. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or as tapes, or that the paper documents or tapes they do store with us will require our storage related services at the same levels as they have in the past. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. as stored records and tapes become less active our service revenue growth and profitability may decline. our records management and data protection service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records and tapes are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years, and we believe this trend continues to accelerate. as a result, while we continue to experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records and rotate tapes, thereby reducing their service activity levels. at the same time many of our costs related to records and tape related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service activity, our operating results could be adversely affected. changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and adopting more aggressive destruction practices. if we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, if we fail to protect our own information, including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states in the united states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached, and, over the past few years, many states expanded the scope of their data breach notifications laws and shortened notification timelines. some states in the united states have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in addition, certain united states federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to comply with any such programs may adversely affect our business. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the united states. for example, the united states congress has considered, and will likely consider again, legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. 15 table of contents also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, or are expected to do so. in europe, regulation (eu) 2016/679 (commonly referred to as gdpr) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data will come into effect in may 2018 and will supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. the new regulation will enhance the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as us, that process data of residents of members of the european economic area and substantially increase penalties for violations. the continued emphasis on information security and compliance as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security, store electronic data locally, and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. attacks on our internal it systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our it systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our it and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or other disruptions. moreover, our ability to integrate businesses we acquire may challenge our ability to prevent such security breaches. we have, and expect to continue to, outsource certain accounting, payroll it, human resource, facility management and back office support services to third parties, which may subject our it and other sensitive information to additional risk. a successful breach of the security of our it systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2017, we operated 1,316 records management, off-site data protection, data center and fine art storage facilities worldwide, including 627 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. a significant aspect of the integration of recall (and other businesses we have acquired or may acquire) with our business is the process of making certain investments in the acquired recall facilities to conform such facilities to our standards of operations. this process is complex and time-consuming. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 16 table of contents our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, information, or other items stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage (such as per cubic foot) and our liability for information governance and digital solutions, data center, destruction and other services unrelated to records, information and other items stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large customers and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as a large percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, and as we expand our operations in storage of fine arts and other valuable items and respond to customer demands for higher limitation of liability as a result of regulatory changes, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2017, we provided storage and information management services in 52 countries outside the united states. our international operations account for a significant portion of our overall operations, and as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us in foreign countries where we operate; in particular, we are subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties and changes in the global political climate which may impose restrictions on global operations; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income, debt balances or leverage can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies. 17 table of contents we have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which primarily transact in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts (including the classification of our distributions as nonqualified ordinary dividends, qualified ordinary dividends or return of capital, as described more fully in "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" included in this annual report) may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. having the united states government as a customer subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties, including those acquired in acquisitions we have completed. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. 18 table of contents unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and some of our key facilities worldwide are subject to this inherent risk. damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our it systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. following the consummation of the iodc transaction, our data center business comprises a greater portion of our overall operations, increasing the likelihood that significant costs or disruptions at our data centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. during 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, we made several acquisitions in the data center space and we expect to continue to grow our data center business, both organically and through acquisitions. our data center business depends on providing customers with highly reliable facilities, power infrastructure and operations solutions, and we will need to retain and hire qualified personnel to manage our data center business. service interruptions or significant equipment damage could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitment obligations that we owe to certain of our customers. service interruptions or equipment damage may occur at one or more of our data centers as a result of numerous factors, including: human error; equipment failure; physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; fire, hurricane, flood, earthquake and other natural disasters; extreme temperatures; power loss or telecommunications failure; war, terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and sabotage and vandalism. our data center business is susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations on the availability of adequate power resources. we rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers. we are therefore subject to an inherent risk that such third parties may fail to deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. if the power delivered to our data centers is insufficient or interrupted, we would be required to provide power through the operation of our on-site generators, generally at a significantly higher operating cost. additionally, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy. we may be limited in our ability to, or may not always choose to, pass these increased costs on to our customers. we also rely on third party telecommunications carriers to provide internet connectivity to our customers. these carriers may elect not to offer their services within our data centers or may elect to discontinue such services. furthermore, carriers may face business difficulties, which could affect their ability to provide telecommunications services or the quality of such services. if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. events such as these may also impact our reputation as a data center provider which could adversely affect our results of operations. our data centers are subject to environmental laws and regulations. for example, our emergency generators are subject to regulations and permit requirements governing air pollutants, and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning and fire suppression systems at some of our data centers as well as our data management locations may include ozone-depleting substances that are subject to regulation. changes in law or our operations could increase compliance costs or impose limitations on our operations. while environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon operations at our data centers, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, could result in unexpected costs due to violation of environmental laws, required permits or additional operation limitations or costs. 19 table of contents furthermore, after giving effect to the iodc transaction, the credit suisse transaction and our acquisition in september 2017 of mag datacenters llc, which operated fortrust, a denver-based data center provider, we will have paid an aggregate cash purchase price of over $1.5 billion for data center businesses in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. we may be required to commit significant operational and financial resources in connection with the growth of our data center business. however, there can be no assurance we will have sufficient customer demand to support these data centers or that we will not be adversely affected by the risks noted above, which could make it difficult for us to realize expected returns on our investments, if any. our shared service center initiative may not create the operational efficiencies that we expect, and may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we have undertaken a shared service center initiative pursuant to which we are centralizing certain finance, human resources and it functions. we have and will continue to align the design and operation of our financial control environment as part of our shared service center initiative. as part of this initiative, we are outsourcing, and will continue to outsource, certain it accounting, payroll, it, facility management, and human resource functions to third party service providers. the parties that we utilize for these services may not be able to handle the volume of activity or perform the quality of service necessary to support our operations. the failure of these parties to fulfill their obligations could disrupt our operations. in addition, the move to a shared service environment, including our reliance on third party providers, may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information. particularly during the transition period, we could experience a lapse in the operation of internal controls due to turnover, lack of legacy knowledge, inappropriate training and use of third party providers, which could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. as a result, significant declines in the cost of paper may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the ip rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their ip rights are being infringed or violated by our use of ip. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the ip on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative ip at our expense to mitigate potential harm. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. 20 table of contents risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2017, our total long-term debt was approximately $7.1 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; and inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions. in connection with the iodc transaction, we incurred approximately $825.0 million of additional indebtedness. as a result of the indebtedness we incurred in connection with the iodc transaction, we are subject to increased risks associated with debt financing, including an increased risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our indentures and our credit agreement contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make acquisitions and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control," as defined in our indentures we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of any outstanding notes or that restrictions in our credit agreement will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. 21 table of contents iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in large part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by our direct and indirect 100% owned united states subsidiaries, that represent the substantial majority of our united states operations. acquisition and expansion risks elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks. as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, including data centers and abos, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. for example, in recent years, we have expanded our entry into the data center and fine art storage businesses. our data center expansion in particular requires significant capital commitments and includes other costs associated with the development of real estate to support this business. many of these new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. we also face competition from other companies in our efforts to grow our adjacent businesses, some of which possess substantial financial and other resources. as a result, we may be unable to acquire, or may pay a significant purchase price for, adjacent businesses that support our strategic growth plan. failure to manage our growth may impact our results of operations. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. for example, the success of our significant acquisitions, such as iodc and recall, will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with ours. to realize these anticipated benefits, we must be able to successfully integrate our business and the acquired businesses, and this integration is complex and time-consuming. we may encounter challenges in the integration process including the following: challenges and difficulties associated with managing our larger, more complex, company; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two businesses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with an acquisition; and our ability to deliver on our strategy going forward. 22 table of contents further, our acquisitions subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at an acquired company, some of which may be unknown. although we and our advisors conduct due diligence on the operations of businesses we acquire, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of an acquired company. these liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to an acquired company not known to us or that we may deem immaterial or unlikely to occur at the time of the acquisition, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into asia, africa and the middle east to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures or have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries or markets where we currently do not operate. a changing global political climate may impose restrictions on our ability to expand internationally. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the united states. we also compete with other storage and information management services providers as well as other entities for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. our net proceeds from the divestments may be lower than expected and we may be subject to liabilities as a result of provisions in the sale agreements governing the divestments. the terms of the sale agreements governing the divestments (as defined in note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) in the united states, canada and australia provide for post-closing adjustments to the purchase prices. as a result, the purchase prices for the divestments may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the sale agreements. as such, the expected net proceeds of the divestments are uncertain and the actual net proceeds we receive from the divestments may be less than the net proceeds expected by us. furthermore, in the sale agreements governing the divestments, we have made certain representations and warranties and are bound by certain covenants following the closings. any breach of such terms may subject us to liabilities in accordance with the terms of the sale agreements. 23 table of contents we have guaranteed certain obligations of recall to brambles relating to brambles' prior demerger transaction. on december 18, 2013, brambles limited, an australian corporation ("brambles"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of recall to brambles' shareholders (the demerger ). prior to and in connection with the demerger, brambles spun off certain of its united states and canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to recall. such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under united states and canadian tax laws, respectively, and brambles obtained rulings from the irs (with respect to the united states spin-off) and the canada revenue agency (with respect to the canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. however, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such united states subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such united states subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off. in connection with the demerger, recall agreed to indemnify brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by recall (e.g., an acquisition of recall shares) resulted in the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for united states or canadian tax purposes, respectively. in addition, recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the united states spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin-offs failing to be tax-free under united states federal income tax law or canadian tax law, respectively. recall has obtained such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by recall and us. such opinions do not affect recall's obligation to indemnify brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs. we have guaranteed the foregoing indemnification obligations of recall. consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that the recall transaction is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off, respectively. however, if the irs or the canadian revenue agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material. risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. we have elected to be taxed as a reit since our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply. qualification for taxation as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable reit provisions. if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced. 24 table of contents as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax. we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, interest expense deductions limited by section 163(j) of the code, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code. we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks relating to our indebtedness." whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of any potential issuances of equity securities, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. in addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a reit. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets or to forgo our pursuit of otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"), and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing. 25 table of contents we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. in addition, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss. our ability to fully deduct our interest expense may be limited, or we may be required to adjust the tax depreciation of our real property in order to maintain the full deductibility of our interest expense. december 2017 amendments to the code, which are described more fully in the tax reform section of "critical accounting policies" within item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report (the "tax reform legislation"), limit interest deductions for businesses, whether in corporate or passthrough form, to the sum of the taxpayer's business interest income for the tax year and 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for that tax year. this limitation does not apply to an electing real property trade or business. we have not yet determined whether we or any of our subsidiaries will elect out of the new interest expense limitation or whether any of our subsidiaries is eligible to elect out, although legislative history indicates that a real property trade or business includes a trade or business conducted by a corporation or a reit. depreciable real property (including specified improvements) held by electing real property trades or businesses must be depreciated for united states federal income tax purposes under the alternative depreciation system of the code, which generally imposes a class life for depreciable real property of up to 40 years. as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss. our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space or colocation or wholesale data center space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability. in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements. our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. our operations include an extensive use of trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. further, a substantial portion of our trss are overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could also negatively impact our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. the tax reform legislation has imposed limitations on the ability of our trss to utilize specified income tax deductions, including limits on the use of net operating losses and limits on the deductibility of interest expense. further, these amendments made substantial changes to the taxation of international income. some of these changes did not contemplate what we believe were unintended consequences of such reforms on reits with global operations, and we may be required to recognize income on account of the activities of our foreign trss that may not be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests that we are required to satisfy . 26 table of contents our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. a reit generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income to its stockholders. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. our information management services businesses and several of our international operations are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. we will also be subject to a federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate (currently 21%, following the enactment of the tax reform legislation) on gains recognized from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2014, or (ii) an asset that we hold in one of our qualified reit subsidiaries ("qrss") following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this 21% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset (e.g., january 1, 2014 in the case of reit assets we held at the time of our reit conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. in addition, depreciation recapture income that we expect to recognize as a result of certain accounting method changes that we have made will be fully subject to this 21% tax. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-united states operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges, do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them and may expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future income or gain in the trss. 27 table of contents distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates. dividends payable by united states corporations to noncorporate stockholders, such as individuals, trusts and estates, are generally eligible for reduced united states federal income tax rates applicable to qualified dividends. distributions paid by reits generally are not treated as qualified dividends under the code, and the reduced rates applicable to such dividends do not generally apply. however, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026, reit dividends paid to noncorporate stockholders are generally taxed at an effective tax rate lower than applicable ordinary income tax rates due to the availability of a deduction under the code for specified forms of income from passthrough entities. more favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends, which may cause some investors to perceive that an investment in a reit is less attractive than an investment in a non-reit entity that pays dividends, thereby reducing the demand and market price of our common stock. the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elected to be taxed as a reit. in addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying reit income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the code. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a reit from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. at any time, the federal or state income tax laws governing reits, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury (the "treasury") and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of trss, particularly non-united states trss. 28 table of contents the tax reform legislation has made substantial changes to the code, particularly as it relates to the taxation of both corporate income and international income. among those changes are a significant permanent reduction in the generally applicable corporate income tax rate and the modification of tax policies, credits and deductions for businesses and individuals. this legislation also imposes additional limitations on the deduction of net operating losses, which may in the future cause us to make distributions that will be taxable to our stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements. the effect of these and other changes made in this legislation is highly uncertain, both in terms of their direct effect on the taxation of an investment in our securities and their indirect effect on the value of properties owned by us. furthermore, many of the provisions of the new law will require guidance through the issuance of treasury regulations in order to assess their effect. there may be a substantial delay before such regulations are promulgated, increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us or our stockholders. it is also possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the tax reform legislation, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us or our stockholders. our stockholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors about the potential effects that changes in law may have on them and their ownership of our securities. risks related to our common stock sales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. in october 2017, we established an "at-the-market" stock offering program (the "at the market (atm) equity program") with a syndicate of 10 banks (the agents ), pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common stock through the agents. as of december 31, 2017, we have sold 1,481,053 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $60.0 million under the at the market (atm) equity program. the ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in the interest of our stockholders. our board of directors determines our major policies, including policies and guidelines relating to our investments, acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, operations and distributions to our stockholders. our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 85 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2017 relate to cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with seven global banks and 12 "triple a" rated money market funds, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. as of december 31, 2017 , our cash and cash equivalents balance was $925.7 million , which included money market funds amounting to $585.0 million and time deposits amounting to $24.5 million . interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we may use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2017 , we had $1,354.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 4.4%, and $5,775.0 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2017 , approximately 81% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2017 would have been reduced by approximately $15.0 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2017 . currency risk our international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real and the australian dollar. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our treasury centers in europe, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. 85 table of contents we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada, australia, and continental europe. im uk has financed a portion of its capital needs through the issuance in british pounds sterling of the gbp notes due 2025. our australian business has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in australian dollars under the aud term loan. similarly, canada company has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and through the issuance of the cad notes due 2023. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we designated a portion of the euro notes and our euro denominated borrowings by imi under the revolving credit facility as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $15.0 million ($15.0 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2017, cumulative net gains of $3.2 million , net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. historically, we have entered into forward contracts to hedge our exposures in euros, british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward contracts to (i) purchase $138.8 million united states dollars and sell 176.0 million canadian dollars, (ii) purchase 135.0 million euros and sell $160.8 million united states dollars and (iii) purchase $114.4 million united states dollars and sell 96.2 million euros to hedge our foreign exchange exposures. at the maturity of any forward contract, we may enter into a new forward contract to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from any forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated any of the forward contracts we have entered as hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2017, cash receipts included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts were $9.1 million . we recorded net gains in connection with forward contracts of $8.3 million , including an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.8 million related to the forward contracts in other expense (income), net as of december 31, 2017 in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2017 , except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2017 functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $241.5 million.risk factors 6 risk factors" of this annual report. iii table of contents you should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as

underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, has approximately 225,000 customers in a variety of industries in approximately 50 countries around the world, as of december 31, 2018. we currently serve customers across an array of market verticals - commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, business services, entertainment and government organizations, including approximately 95% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2018, we employed more than 26,000 people. we are listed on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") and are a constituent of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index and the msci reit index. as of december 31, 2018, we were number 619 on the fortune 1000. we have been organized and have operated as a reit beginning with our taxable year ended december 31, 2014. business strategy overview our company has been a market leader in the physical ecosystem around information storage and retrieval, as most businesses have relied on paper documents or computer tapes to store their valuable information. over time, customers are increasing their digital information, with the new information storage ecosystem being a hybrid of physical and digital mediums. we offer a suite of "mission-critical" storage and related services to help customers with this transformation, and utilize the strategy outlined below to grow our business. driving growth and margins in records and information management in developed markets - we are focused on increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, western europe, australia and new zealand, primarily through more targeted sales and marketing efforts to support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs to us, as well as gaining incremental volumes from existing customers and successful revenue management. we expect to continue to pursue attractive acquisitions, designed to optimize the utilization of our existing assets, expand our presence and better serve our customers, as well as invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. in our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will continue to generate margin expansion opportunities. expansion of records and information management in emerging markets - part of our strategy is to establish and enhance leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america, africa and asia (excluding australia and new zealand, ("emerging markets")), primarily through acquisitions. in our existing emerging markets locations, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses achieve scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of the cash flows generated to support the growth of these businesses. investing in faster-growing businesses - we continue to identify, acquire, incubate and scale complementary adjacent businesses ("abs") to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. the opportunities complementary to our business include entertainment, fine art and consumer storage and related services. 1 table of contents continued expansion of data center business - we have made significant progress through acquisitions and organic growth in scaling our data center business, which began as an ab but has now grown to such a size that we no longer consider it an ab. as of december 31, 2018, 91.4% of our capacity is leased, with total potential capacity of 324.9 megawatts. our strategy is underpinned by our persistent focus on customer experience, as we continue to seek innovative solutions to help our customers navigate the journey from physical storage to a digital ecosystem. business segments the amount of revenues derived from our business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, are set forth

phoenix and scottsdale, arizona and three international markets: amsterdam, london, and singapore. 2 table of contents corporate and other business: our corporate and other business segment primarily consists of the storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types and digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients ( entertainment services ), throughout the united states, canada, france, china - hong kong s.a.r., the netherlands and the united kingdom, and our fine art storage businesses and consumer storage businesses in the united states, canada, europe and china - hong kong s.a.r. these businesses represent the primary offerings of our adjacent businesses operating segment. additionally, our corporate and other business segment includes costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and it, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. our corporate and other business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. business attributes our business has the following attributes: large, diversified, global business - our mission-critical storage offerings and related services generated more than $4.2 billion in annual revenue in 2018. our business has a highly diverse customer base of approximately 225,000 customers - with no single customer accounting for more than 1% of revenue - and operates in approximately 50 countries globally. recurring, durable revenue stream - we generate a majority of our revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly storage rental fees, via contracts that generally range from one-five years in length. historically, we have seen strong customer retention (of approximately 98%) and solid physical records retention; more than 50% of physical records that entered our facilities 15 years ago, are still with us today. significant owner and operator of real estate - we operate approximately 90 million square feet of real estate in over 1,400 facilities worldwide. our owned real estate footprint spans nearly 30 million square feet and is concentrated in major metropolitan statistical areas in north america, western europe and latin america. limited revenue cyclicality - historically, economic downturns have not significantly affected our storage rental business. due to the stability in our total global physical records volumes, the success of our revenue management, and the growth of our data center business, we believe we can continue to grow storage rental revenue over time. shifting revenue mix - our growth portfolio, which consists of our business in emerging markets, our data center business, and our adjacent businesses, comprised 19% of our total revenue in 2018, and grew 7% year over year, on an internal basis. we expect our growth portfolio to comprise an increasingly larger percentage of our overall business in the coming years. significant acquisitions with the rapid acceleration of growth in digital data and use of cloud storage, highly regulated companies and public sector organizations are selecting third-party providers such as us to host their data center infrastructure. we have been providing customers with colocation and wholesale data center space and solutions for more than 15 years, and have significantly expanded our data center business in the last few years with acquisitions, the most significant one being that of io data centers, llc ( iodc ). on january 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the united states operations of iodc, a leading data center colocation space and solutions provider based in phoenix, arizona, for approximately $1.34 billion (the "iodc transaction"). see note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. the purchase included the land and buildings associated with four state-of-the-art data centers in phoenix and scottsdale, arizona, edison, new jersey, and columbus, ohio. this acquisition marked a transformative step toward addressing our customers' data center needs by dramatically expanding our platform and capabilities. with the build-out of our existing footprint and the additional capacity from iodc and other recent acquisitions, our data center portfolio as of december 31, 2018 totals more than 100 megawatts of existing capacity, with an additional 11 megawatts of capacity currently under construction and planned and future expansion potential of another 211 megawatts. 3 table of contents we have completed many acquisitions over the years to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden our offerings. while most of these acquisitions have been smaller in size given the fragmented nature of the records management industry, our acquisition of recall in 2016 was another significant transaction. on may 2, 2016 we purchased recall, a multi-national records and information management company, for approximately $2.2 billion, comprised of $331.8 million in cash and approximately 50.2 million shares of our common stock. competition we compete with storage and information management services managed and operated internally by organizations and thousands of storage and information management services providers around the world. we believe that competition for records and information customers is based on price, reputation and reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in these areas. we also compete with numerous data center developers, owners and operators, many of whom own properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our facilities are located. we believe that competition for data center customers is based on availability of power, security considerations, location, connectivity and rental rates, and we generally believe we compete effectively in each of these areas. additionally, we believe our strong brand, global footprint and excellent commercial relationships enable us to compete successfully. employees as of december 31, 2018, we employed more than 9,000 employees in the united states and more than 17,200 employees outside of the united states. as of december 31, 2018, approximately 500 employees in california, georgia and new jersey and three provinces in canada were represented by unions in north america and approximately 1,400 employees were represented by unions in latin america (in argentina, brazil, chile and mexico). all union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. certain unionized employees in california receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance and contractual limitations on liability for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. 4 table of contents our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability for damages regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, and other information and valuable items stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot, and our liability for data center, igds, destruction services and other services unrelated to records stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as a larger percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental cost and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. corporate social responsibility we are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiative. our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for our efforts in the community, our environment, and for our people. we are a member of the ftse4 good index, msci world esg index, msci acwi esg index and msci usa imi esg index, each of which include companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. a copy of our corporate responsibility report is available on the "about us" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate social responsibility." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com

to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report. copies

section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." 5 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. business risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than traditional physical records and tape storage, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage volume and/or requirements for storage related services may decline. for example, we experienced slight volume declines in our north american records and information management business and north american data management business segments in 2018 and w e expect these trends to continue over the near term. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or as tapes, or that the paper documents or tapes they do store with us will require our storage related services at the same levels as they have in the past. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or non-tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. failure to execute our strategic growth plan may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to continue to invest in our existing businesses, including records and information management storage and services businesses in emerging markets, data centers and abs, and in new businesses, business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: our inability to identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; our inability to complete acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms; our inability to structure investments or acquisitions in a manner that complies with our debt covenants and is consistent with our leverage ratio goals; our inability to successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; failure to achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in markets where we do not currently operate; incurring additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; distraction of management from current operations; increasing our leverage; insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments; and our inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. our data center expansion in particular requires significant capital commitments. we have paid an aggregate cash purchase price of over $1.7 billion for data center businesses in 2017 and 2018. our data center expansion and other new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. we also face competition from other companies in our efforts to grow our data center, international and adjacent businesses, some of which possess substantial financial and other resources. as a result, we may be unable to acquire, or may pay a premium purchase price for, data centers, international and adjacent businesses that support our strategic growth plan. 6 table of contents as stored records and tapes become less active our service revenue growth and profitability from related services may decline. our records management and data management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records and tapes are becoming less active and more archival. the amount of information available to customers digitally or in their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years, and we believe this trend continues to accelerate. as a result, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records and rotate tapes, thereby reducing their activity levels. at the same time, many of our costs related to records and tape related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service activity, our operating results could be adversely affected. our future growth depends in part upon our ability to continue to effectively manage and execute on revenue management. over the past years, our internal revenue growth has been positively impacted by our ability to effectively introduce, expand and monitor revenue management initially in our developed markets, and subsequently in our emerging markets. if we are not able to continue and effectively manage pricing, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute on our strategic growth plan. changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. over the past year, we have experienced increased destruction rates (as a percentage of inventory). while increased destruction rates have a positive impact on our service revenues in the year of destruction, it negatively impacts our longer term storage revenues. if destruction rates do not decrease to historical levels or continue to increase, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, if we fail to protect our own information, including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, all states in the united states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers and regulators if the security of their personal information is breached, and, over the past few years, many states expanded the scope of their data breach notifications laws and shortened notification timelines. some states in the united states have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in addition, certain united states federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to comply with any such programs may adversely affect our business. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the united states. for example, the united states congress has considered, and will likely consider again, legislation that would not only expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and healthcare fields but also grant consumers privacy rights similar to those conferred under regulation (eu) 2016/679 (commonly referred to as "gdpr") in europe (as discussed further below). also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, or are expected to do so. in europe, gdpr, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, went into effect in may 2018. gdpr enhances the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as us, that process data of residents of members of the european economic area and substantially increases penalties for violations. 7 table of contents the continued emphasis on information security and compliance as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security, store electronic data locally, and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. attacks on our internal it systems could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our it systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our it and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or other disruptions. moreover, our ability to integrate businesses we acquire may challenge our ability to prevent such security breaches. we have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain accounting, payroll, it, human resource, facility management and back office support services to third parties, which may subject our it and other sensitive information to additional risk. a successful breach of the security of our it systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense. as of december 31, 2018 we operated over 1,400 facilities worldwide, including over 600 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances local authorities may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. a significant aspect of the integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire is the process of making investments in the acquired facilities to conform such facilities to our standards of operations. this process is complex and time-consuming. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 8 table of contents changes to environmental laws and standards may increase the cost to operate some of our businesses. furthermore, if we fail to meet our commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. this could impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock. changes in environmental laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase compliance costs or impose limitations on our operations. for example, our emergency generators at our data centers are subject to regulations and permit requirements governing air pollutants, and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning and fire suppression systems at some of our data centers and data management locations may include ozone-depleting substances that are subject to regulation. while environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon operations at our facilities, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, could result in unexpected costs, which could be material. furthermore, we have made a commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy. if we are not successful in this transition, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. this could negatively impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock. failure to manage our growth may impact our results of operations. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, information, or other items stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage (such as per cubic foot) and our liability for igds, data center, destruction and other services unrelated to records, information and other items stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large customers and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and related service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as a large percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, and as we expand our operations in storage of fine arts and other valuable items and respond to customer demands for higher limitation of liability as a result of regulatory changes, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. 9 table of contents international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2018, we operated in approximately 50 countries outside the united states. our international operations account for a significant portion of our overall operations, and as part of our growth strategy, we expect its share to increase as we continue to acquire or invest in businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us in foreign countries where we operate; in particular, we are subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties and changes in the global political climate which may impose restrictions on global operations; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income, cash flows, debt balances or leverage can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies. we have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which primarily transact in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts (including the classification of our distributions as nonqualified ordinary dividends, qualified ordinary dividends or return of capital, as described more fully in "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" included in this annual report) may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. 10 table of contents significant costs or disruptions at our data centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. during the prior two years, we have substantially expanded our data center business through acquisitions and organically and we expect to continue to grow our data center business in both ways going forward. for example, we paid an aggregate cash purchase price of over $1.7 billion for data center businesses we acquired in 2017 and 2018 and incurred other costs associated with the development of real estate to support this business. our data center business depends on providing customers with highly reliable facilities, power infrastructure and operations solutions, and we will need to retain and hire qualified personnel to manage our data center business. service interruptions or significant equipment damage could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitment obligations that we owe to certain of our customers. service interruptions or equipment damage may occur at one or more of our data centers as a result of numerous factors, including: human error; equipment failure; physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; fire, hurricane, flood, earthquake and other natural disasters; extreme temperatures; power loss or telecommunications failure; war, terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and sabotage and vandalism. in addition, climate change may increase the likelihood that our data centers are affected by some of these factors. while these risks could impact our overall business, they could have a more significant impact on our data center business, where w e have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. as a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. because our data centers are critical to many of our customers' businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. our data center business is susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations on the availability of adequate power resources. we rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers. we are therefore subject to an inherent risk that such third parties may fail to deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. if the power delivered to our data centers is insufficient or interrupted, we would be required to provide power through the operation of our on-site generators, generally at a significantly higher operating cost. additionally, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy, and we may be limited in our ability to, or may not always choose to, pass these increased costs on to our customers. we also rely on third party telecommunications carriers to provide internet connectivity to our customers. these carriers may elect not to offer or to restrict their services within our data centers or may elect to discontinue such services. furthermore, carriers may face business difficulties, which could affect their ability to provide telecommunications services or the quality of such services. if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. events such as these may also impact our reputation as a data center provider which could adversely affect our results of operations. we may be required to commit significant operational and financial resources in connection with the organic growth of our data center business, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have sufficient customer demand to support these data centers when they are built. there can be no assurance we will have sufficient customer demand to support these data centers or data centers we have acquired or that we will not be adversely affected by the risks noted above, which could make it difficult for us to realize expected returns on our investments, if any. 11 table of contents failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position and reputation. having the united states government as a customer subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. for example, the success of our significant acquisitions depends, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with ours. to realize these anticipated benefits, we must be able to successfully integrate our business and the acquired businesses, and this integration is complex and time-consuming. we may encounter challenges in the integration process including the following: challenges and difficulties associated with managing our larger, more complex, company; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation and benefits structures between the two businesses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with an acquisition; and our ability to deliver on our strategy going forward. further, our acquisitions subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at an acquired company, some of which may be unknown. although we and our advisors conduct due diligence on the operations of businesses we acquire, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of an acquired company. these liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to an acquired company not known to us or that we may deem immaterial or unlikely to occur at the time of the acquisition, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america, asia and australia have historically been our primary areas of focus for international expansion of our records and information management services business, with expansion of our records and information management services business into africa and the middle east and expansion of our data center and adjacent business operations becoming more of a focus recently. we have entered into joint ventures or have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services and data center businesses operating in these areas and may enter into joint ventures and/or acquire other storage and information management services, data center or adjacent businesses in the future, including in new countries or markets where we currently do not operate. a changing global political climate may impose restrictions on our ability to expand internationally. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. 12 table of contents we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and we expect this trend to continue due to climate change. some of our key facilities worldwide are vulnerable to severe weather events. damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our it systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13 table of contents our shared service center initiative may not create the operational efficiencies that we expect, and may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. we have undertaken a shared service center initiative pursuant to which we are centralizing certain finance, human resources and it functions. we have and will continue to align the design and operation of our financial control environment as part of our shared service center initiative. as part of this initiative, we are outsourcing, and will continue to outsource, certain accounting, payroll, it, facility management, and human resource functions to third party service providers. the parties that we utilize for these services may not be able to handle the volume of activity or perform the quality of service necessary to support our operations. the failure of these parties to fulfill their obligations could disrupt our operations. in addition, the move to a shared service environment, including our reliance on third party providers, may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information. we could experience a lapse in the operation of internal controls due to turnover, lack of legacy knowledge, inappropriate training and use of third party providers, which could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. as a result, significant declines in the cost of paper may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property ("ip") rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their ip rights are being infringed or violated by our use of ip. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the ip on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative ip at our expense to mitigate potential harm. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple businesses in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. we have guaranteed certain obligations of recall to brambles relating to brambles' prior demerger transaction. on december 18, 2013, brambles limited, an australian corporation ("brambles"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of recall to brambles' shareholders (the demerger ). prior to and in connection with the demerger, brambles spun off certain of its united states and canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to recall. such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under united states and canadian tax laws, respectively, and brambles obtained rulings from the united states internal revenue service (the "irs") (with respect to the united states spin-off) and the canada revenue agency (with respect to the canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. however, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such united states subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such united states subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off. 14 table of contents in connection with the demerger, recall agreed to indemnify brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by recall (e.g., an acquisition of recall shares) resulted in the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for united states or canadian tax purposes, respectively. in addition, recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the united states spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin- offs failing to be tax-free under united states federal income tax law or canadian tax law, respectively. recall has obtained such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by recall and us. such opinions do not affect recall's obligation to indemnify brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs. we have guaranteed the foregoing indemnification obligations of recall. consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that the recall transaction is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off, respectively. however, if the irs or the canadian revenue agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material. risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2018, our total long-term debt was approximately $8.2 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our data center business and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of our various indebtedness; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; and inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing. 15 table of contents restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our indentures and our credit agreement (as defined in note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; sell, transfer or exchange assets; guarantee certain indebtedness; make acquisitions and other investments; and enter into partnerships and joint ventures. these restrictions and our long-term commitment to reduce our leverage ratio may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control," as defined in our indentures we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of any outstanding notes or that restrictions in our credit agreement will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in large part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries, whose ability to distribute funds may be limited by local capital requirements, joint venture structures and other applicable restrictions. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by our direct and indirect 100% owned united states subsidiaries, which represent the substantial majority of our united states operations. risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. we have elected to be taxed as a reit since our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply. qualification for taxation as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable reit provisions. if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit. 16 table of contents any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced. as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax. we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code. we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks relating to our indebtedness." whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of any potential issuances of equity securities, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. in addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a reit. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets or to forgo our pursuit of otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 17 table of contents complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities we would otherwise pursue to execute our growth strategy. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"), and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. this may restrict our ability to enter into joint ventures or acquire minority interests of companies. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing. we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. in addition, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss. as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss. our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space or colocation or wholesale data center space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability. in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements. our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. our operations include an extensive use of trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. further, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could also affect the value of our foreign holdings in our trss, negatively impacting our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. december 2017 amendments to the code, which are described more fully in the tax reform section of "critical accounting policies" within item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report (the tax reform legislation ), impose limitations on the ability of our trss to deduct certain items for income tax purposes, including limits on the use of net operating losses and limits on the deductibility of interest expense. 18 table of contents even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. our information management services businesses and several of our international operations are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. we will also be subject to a federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate (currently 21%) on gains we recognize within a specified period from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as an asset that we hold in one of our qualified reit subsidiaries ("qrss") following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this 21% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. in addition, depreciation recapture income that we expect to recognize as a result of certain accounting method changes that we have made will be fully subject to this 21% tax. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non- united states operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges, do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them and may expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future income or gain in the trss. distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates. dividends payable by united states corporations to noncorporate stockholders, such as individuals, trusts and estates, are generally eligible for reduced united states federal income tax rates applicable to qualified dividends. distributions paid by reits generally are not treated as qualified dividends under the code, and the reduced rates applicable to such dividends do not generally apply. however, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026, reit dividends paid to noncorporate stockholders are generally taxed at an effective tax rate lower than applicable ordinary income tax rates due to the availability of a deduction under the code for specified forms of income from passthrough entities. more favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends, which may cause some investors to perceive that an investment in a reit is less attractive than an investment in a non-reit entity that pays dividends, thereby reducing the demand and market price of our common stock. 19 table of contents the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elected to be taxed as a reit. in addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying reit income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the code. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a reit from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. at any time, the federal or state income tax laws governing reits, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury (the "treasury") and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of trss, particularly non-united states trss. the tax reform legislation made substantial changes to the code, particularly as it relates to the taxation of both corporate income and international income. among those changes are a significant permanent reduction in the generally applicable corporate income tax rate and the modification of tax policies, credits and deductions for businesses and individuals. this legislation also imposes additional limitations on the deduction of net operating losses, which may in the future cause us to make distributions that will be taxable to our stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements. the effect of these and other changes made in this legislation is still uncertain in many respects, both in terms of their direct effect on the taxation of an investment in our securities and their indirect effect on the value of properties owned by us. furthermore, many of the provisions of the new law will require additional guidance in order to assess their effect. it is also possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the tax reform legislation, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us or our stockholders. our stockholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors about the potential effects that changes in law may have on them and their ownership of our securities. 20 table of contents risks related to our common stock sales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. in october 2017, we established an "at-the-market" stock offering program (the "at the market (atm) equity program") with a syndicate of 10 banks (the agents ), pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common stock through the agents. as of december 31, 2018, we have sold 1,754,539 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $68.8 million under the at the market (atm) equity program. see note 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. a reit generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income to its stockholders. furthermore, we are committed to growing our dividends, and have stated this publicly. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and related services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate and we may not be able to meet our public commitments with respect to dividend growth. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 70 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2018 relate to cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with seven global banks, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of 1% of the fund total assets or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. as of december 31, 2018 , our cash and cash equivalents balance was $165.5 million . interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we may use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2018 , we had $2,119.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 4.5%, and $6,109.6 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2018 , approximately 74% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2018 would have been reduced by approximately $18.7 million . see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2018 . currency risk our international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real and the australian dollar. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. 70 table of contents we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada, australia, latin america and continental europe. im uk has financed a portion of its capital needs through the issuance in british pounds sterling of the gbp notes due 2025. our australian business has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in australian dollars under the aud term loan. similarly, iron mountain canada operations ulc has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and through the issuance of the cad notes due 2023. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we designated a portion of the euro notes as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $11.1 million ( $11.1 million , net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2018 , cumulative net gains of $14.3 million , net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. historically, we have entered into forward contracts to hedge our exposures in euros, british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase 29.0 million euros and sell $33.4 million united states dollars to hedge our foreign exchange exposures. at the maturity of any forward contract, we may enter into a new forward contract to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from any forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated any of the forward contracts we have entered as hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2018 , cash receipts included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts were $5.8 million . we recorded net gains in connection with forward contracts of $5.0 million , including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million related to the forward contracts in other expense (income), net as of december 31, 2018 in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2018 , except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2018 functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $294.2 million.risk factors 7 risk factors" of this annual report. iii table of

overview we help organizations around the world protect their information, reduce storage costs, comply with regulations, facilitate corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information and it infrastructure for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or life cycle stage. we do this by storing physical records and data backup media, offering information management solutions, and providing data center space for enterprise-class colocation and hyperscale deployments. we offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, legal and regulatory compliance, and disaster recovery requirements. we provide secure and reliable data center facilities to protect digital information and ensure the continued operation of our customers' it infrastructure, with reliable and flexible deployment options. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, has more than 225,000 customers in a variety of industries in approximately 50 countries around the world, as of december 31, 2019. we currently serve customers across an array of market verticals - commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, business services, entertainment and government organizations, including approximately 96% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2019, we employed more than 25,000 people. we are listed on the new york stock exchange (the "nyse") and are a constituent of the standard &amp; poor's 500 index and the msci reit index. as of december 31, 2019, we were number 605 on the fortune 1000. we have been organized and have operated as a reit beginning with our taxable year ended december 31, 2014. business strategy overview our company has been a market leader in the physical ecosystem supporting information storage and retrieval, as most businesses have relied on paper documents or computer tapes to store their valuable information. over time, customers are increasing their digital information, with the new information storage ecosystem being a hybrid of physical and digital mediums. we offer a suite of "mission-critical" storage and related services to help customers with this transformation, and utilize the strategy outlined below to grow our business. pursuing volume opportunities in records and information management globally with a focus on faster-growing geographies and verticals - we are establishing and enhancing leadership positions in higher-growth markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america, asia and africa, through both organic expansion and acquisitions where gdp growth is faster and outsourcing information management is at an earlier stage. we are also focused on increasing revenues in more established markets such as the united states, canada, western europe, australia and new zealand, primarily through targeted sales and marketing efforts to attract new customers or to gain incremental volumes from existing customers. we believe much of the opportunity for new customers is from existing verticals that do not already outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs to us or another third party vendor. we expect to continue to invest in attractive acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses, designed to optimize the utilization of our existing assets and to expand our presence and better serve our customers. driving revenue growth and margin expansion through revenue management and continuous improvement - we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion through further deployment of our revenue management program. further, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate additional margin expansion opportunities, primarily in our established markets. in our higher-growth markets, we expect profits will grow with increased scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of the cash flows generated to support expansion in these markets. continued expansion of data center business - we have made significant progress through acquisitions and organic growth in scaling our data center business, with 14 operating data centers across 13 global markets. as of december 31, 2019, approximately 86% of our capacity is leased, with total potential capacity of 357 megawatts in land and buildings currently owned or operated by iron mountain making us among the largest global data center operators. 1 table of contents investing in faster-growing businesses - we continue to identify, acquire, incubate and scale complementary businesses and products to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. these opportunities include our entertainment services, fine arts and consumer storage (each as defined below) businesses and digital services. our strategy is underpinned by our persistent focus on customer experience, as we continue to seek innovative solutions to help our customers navigate the journey from physical storage to a digital ecosystem. project summit in october 2019, we announced our global program designed to better position us for future growth and achievement of our strategic objectives ("project summit"). project summit focuses on simplifying our global structure by combining our core records and information management operations under one global leader and rebalancing our resources, streamlining managerial structures and leveraging our global and regional customer facing resources. we are also implementing systems and process changes designed to make our organization more agile and dynamic, streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our strategic goals as part of project summit. as a result of the program, we expect to reduce the number of positions at vice president and above by approximately 45%. the total program is expected to have reduced our total managerial and administrative workforce by approximately 700 positions by the end of 2021. the activities associated with project summit began in the fourth quarter of 2019 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2021. we estimate that project summit will improve annual adjusted ebitda (as defined in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) by approximately $200 million as program benefits are realized, with the total program benefits associated with project summit expected to be fully realized by the end of 2022. we estimate that the implementation of project summit will result in total costs of approximately $240 million. as we simplify our global structure and combine our core records and information management operations under one global leader, we have reassessed the composition of our business segments. our previous north american records and information management business, north american data management business, western european business and other international business segments have been combined into one global records and information management ("global rim") business segment with certain product lines now captured in our corporate and other business segment. business segments the amount of revenues derived from our business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. global rim business: our global rim business segment includes five distinct offerings. records management , stores physical records, including media such as microfilm and microfiche, film, x-rays and blueprints, and provides healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents (collectively, "records management") for customers in approximately 50 countries around the globe. as of december 31, 2019, iron mountain stored approximately 700 million cubic feet of hardcopy records. data management, provides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ( data protection &amp; recovery ); server and computer backup services; and related services offerings, (collectively, "data management"). information governance and digital solutions ("igds") , develops, implements and supports comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information, including the management of physical records, conversion of documents to digital formats and digital storage, primarily in the united states and canada. 2 table of contents secure shredding , which includes the scheduled pick-up of office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. secure shredding, which involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us, is a natural extension of our hard copy records management operations and completes the lifecycle of a record. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of shredding facilities and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the united states, canada and south africa. consumer storage provides on-demand, valet storage for consumers ( consumer storage ) across 24 markets in north america through a strategic partnership (the "makespace jv") with makespace labs, inc. ( makespace ) formed in march 2019. the makespace jv is intended to utilize data analytics and machine learning to provide effective customer acquisition and a convenient and seamless consumer experience. global data center business: our global data center business segment provides enterprise-class data center facilities to protect mission-critical assets and ensure the continued operation of our customers' it infrastructure, with secure, reliable and flexible data center options. the world's most heavily regulated organizations have trusted us with their data centers for over 15 years, and as of december 31, 2019, five of the top 10 global cloud providers were iron mountain data center customers. as of december 31, 2019, our global data center business footprint spanned nine markets in the united states: denver, colorado; kansas city, missouri; boston, massachusetts; boyers, pennsylvania; manassas, virginia; edison, new jersey; columbus, ohio; and phoenix and scottsdale, arizona and four international markets: amsterdam, london, and singapore, with land held for development in frankfurt. corporate and other business: our corporate and other business segment consists primarily of adjacent businesses and other corporate items. adjacent businesses is comprised of (i) entertainment and media which helps industry clients store, safeguard and deliver physical media of all types, and provides digital content repository systems that house, distribute, and archive key media assets, throughout the united states, canada, france, china - hong kong s.a.r., the netherlands and the united kingdom ("entertainment services") and (ii) technical expertise in the handling, installation and storing of art in the united states, canada and europe ("fine arts"). our corporate and other business segment also includes costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and it, which benefit the enterprise as a whole, and stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. additionally, our corporate and other business segment includes our technology escrow services business in the united states. business attributes our business has the following attributes: large, diversified, global business - the world's most heavily regulated organizations trust us with the storage of their records. our mission-critical storage offerings and related services generated approximately $4.3 billion in annual revenue in 2019. our business has a highly diverse customer base of approximately 225,000 customers - with no single customer accounting for more than 1% of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019 - and operates in approximately 50 countries globally. this presents a significant cross-sell opportunity for our data center and digital services businesses. recurring, durable revenue stream - we generate a majority of our revenues from contracted storage rental fees, via agreements that generally range from one to five years in length. historically, in our records management business, we have seen strong customer retention (of approximately 98%) and solid physical records retention; more than 50% of physical records that entered our facilities 15 years ago, are still with us today. we have also seen strong customer retention in our global data center business, with low annual customer churn of approximately 4%. 3 table of contents comprehensive information management solution - as an s&amp;p 500 reit with approximately 1,450 locations globally and with offerings spanning physical storage, digitization services and digital storage, we are positioned to provide a holistic offering to our customers. we are able to cater to our customers' physical and digital needs and to help guide their digital transformation journey. significant owner and operator of real estate - we operate approximately 91 million square feet of real estate worldwide. our owned real estate footprint spans nearly 30 million square feet and is concentrated in major metropolitan statistical areas in north america, western europe and latin america. limited revenue cyclicality - historically, economic downturns have not significantly affected our storage rental business. due to the stability in our total global physical records volumes, the success of our revenue management, and the growth of our global data center business, we believe we can continue to grow storage rental revenue over time. shifting revenue mix - our growth portfolio, which consists of our business in our higher-growth markets, our global data center business, and our adjacent businesses, comprised 24% of our total revenue in 2019, and grew 4% year over year, on an organic basis. we expect our growth portfolio to comprise an increasingly larger percentage of our overall business in the coming years. in addition, our data center business has the following attributes: large data center platform with significant expansion opportunity - with over 3.5 million gross square feet, as of december 31, 2019, we have 120 mw of leasable capacity with an additional 237 mw under construction or held for development. differentiated compliance and security - we offer comprehensive compliance support and physical and cyber security. our multi-layered approach to security includes a combination of technical and human security measures, and experienced senior military and public sector cyber security leaders lead our security. as of december 31, 2019, iron mountain data centers meet fisma high and pci-dss compliance standards and are fedramp compliant. efficient access and flexibility - we have the ability to provide customers with a range of deployment options from one cabinet to an entire building, leveraging our global portfolio of hyperscale-ready, and underground data centers. we also provide access to numerous carriers, cloud providers and peering exchanges with migration support and it. 100% green powered data centers - as of december 31, 2019, iron mountain data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy, with carbon credit assistance and low power usage effectiveness ("pue"). iron mountain is one of the top 25 buyers of renewable energy among the fortune 1000 and now offers the green power pass, which allows customers to include the power they consume at any iron mountain data center as green power in their cdp, re100, gri, or other sustainability reporting. significant acquisitions we have completed many records management acquisitions over the years to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden our offerings, but most of our records management acquisitions in recent years have been smaller in size given the fragmented nature of the records management industry. with the rapid acceleration of growth in digital data and use of cloud storage, highly regulated companies and public sector organizations are selecting third-party providers such as us to host their data center infrastructure. we have been providing customers with data center space and solutions for more than 15 years, and have significantly expanded our global data center business in the last few years through acquisitions, the most significant one being that of io data centers, llc ( iodc ). on january 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the united states operations of iodc, a leading data center colocation space and solutions provider based in phoenix, arizona, for approximately $1.34 billion (the "iodc transaction"). see note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 4 table of contents competition we compete with thousands of storage and information management services providers around the world as well as storage and information management services managed and operated internally by organizations. we believe that competition for records and information customers is based on price, reputation and reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology. while the majority of our competitors operate in only one market or region, we believe we provide a differentiated global offering that competes effectively in these areas. we also compete with numerous data center developers, owners and operators, many of whom own properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our facilities are located. we believe that competition for data center customers is based on availability of power, security considerations, location, connectivity and rental rates, and we generally believe we compete effectively in each of these areas. additionally, we believe our strong brand, global footprint and excellent commercial relationships enable us to compete successfully. employees as of december 31, 2019, we employed more than 9,000 employees in the united states and more than 16,000 employees outside of the united states. as of december 31, 2019, approximately 550 employees in california, georgia and new jersey and three provinces in canada were represented by unions in north america and approximately 1,200 employees were represented by unions in latin america (in argentina, brazil, chile and mexico). all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. where applicable, employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which may include health and welfare arrangements as well as pension programs. certain unionized employees in california receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental cost and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. 5 table of contents corporate social responsibility we are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiative. our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for our efforts in the community, our environment, and for our people. we are a member of the ftse4 good index, msci world esg index, msci acwi esg index and msci usa imi esg index, each of which include companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. a copy of our corporate responsibility report is available on the "about us" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate social responsibility." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "investors" section on our website, we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, finance, nominating and governance, and risk and safety committees are available on the "investors" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." 6 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. business risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than traditional physical records and tape storage, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage volume and/or requirements for storage related services may decline. for example, volumes in our global rim business segment were relatively steady in 2019 and w e expect them to remain relatively consistent in the near term. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or as tapes, or that the paper documents or tapes they do store with us will require our storage related services at the same levels as they have in the past. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or non-tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. in addition, the digitization of records may shift our revenue mix from the more predictable storage revenue to service revenue, which is inherently more volatile. failure to execute our strategic growth plan may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to continue to invest in our existing businesses, including records and information management storage and services businesses in our higher-growth markets, data centers and adjacent businesses, and in new businesses, business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: our inability to identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; our inability to complete acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms; our inability to structure investments or acquisitions in a manner that complies with our debt covenants and is consistent with our leverage ratio goals; increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources and, if necessary, our inability to successfully expand our infrastructure; our inability to execute on our plans to help our customers digitize their records or incorporate new technologies into our offerings; failure to achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies or other investments, particularly in markets where we do not currently operate; incurring additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies or make other growth investments if we are unable to pay the purchase price or make the investment out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; our inability to manage the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business; insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments; and our inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support our strategic growth plan. our data center expansion in particular requires significant capital commitments. our data center expansion and other new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. we also face competition from other companies in our efforts to grow our data center, international and complementary businesses, some of which possess substantial financial and other resources. as a result, we may be unable to acquire, invest in, or may pay a premium purchase price for, data centers, technology and higher-growth markets and adjacent businesses that support our strategic growth plan, or we may fail to manage the growth of any businesses we acquire or invest in, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 7 table of contents as stored records and tapes become less active our service revenue growth and profitability from related services may decline. o ur records management and data management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records and tapes are becoming less active and more archival. the amount of information available to customers digitally or in their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years, and we believe this trend continues to accelerate. as a result, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records and rotate tapes, thereby reducing their activity levels. at the same time, many of our costs related to records and tape related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service activity, our operating results could be adversely affected. our program to simplify our global structure may not be successful. in october 2019, we announced project summit, a global program designed to better position us for future growth and achievement of our strategic objectives. project summit focuses on simplifying our global records and information management structure, streamlining our managerial structure and leveraging our global and regional customer facing resources. as a result of the program, we expect to reduce the number of positions at vice president and above by approximately 45%. the total program is expected to have reduced our total managerial and administrative workforce by approximately 700 positions by the end of 2021. we also plan to implement systems and process changes designed to make our organization more agile and dynamic, streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our strategic goals. we expect the total program benefits associated with project summit to be fully realized by the end of 2022. we have included in this annual report on form 10-k estimates of expected improvements to our adjusted ebitda and the costs (including operating and capital expenditures) we expect to incur. however, we may not be able to realize the full amount of our expected improvements to adjusted ebitda in a timely manner, or at all, and the costs associated project summit may exceed our expectations. in addition, this program may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, distraction of our employees and our anticipated systems and process changes may not work as expected and may create additional risks to our business. as a result, project summit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. our future growth depends in part upon our ability to continue to effectively manage and execute on revenue management. over the past several years, our organic revenue growth has been positively impacted by our ability to effectively introduce, expand and monitor revenue management initially in our more established markets, and subsequently in our higher-growth markets. if we are not able to continue and effectively manage pricing, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute on our strategic growth plan. changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. over the past year, our destruction rates as a percentage of records stored have fluctuated. when destruction rates increase, it has a positive impact on our service revenues in the year of destruction, but negatively impacts our longer term storage revenues, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. we and our customers are subject to laws and governmental regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity and our customers' demands in this area are increasing. this may cause us to incur significant expenses and non-compliance with such regulations and demands could harm our business. we are subject to numerous u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity. these regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the u.s. congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us. in addition, a growing number of u.s. and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements if consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such information are possible. in the u.s., we are subject to various state laws which provide for disparate notification regimes. in addition, as a result of the continued emphasis on information security and instances in which personal information has been compromised, our customers are requesting that we take additional measures to enhance security, store electronic data locally, and assume higher liability under our contracts. 8 table of contents we devote substantial resources, and may in the future have to devote significant additional resources, to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations, our customers' demands and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations or breaches. any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations or breaches of, laws and regulations or customer requirements could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations, the imposition of fines and penalties, liability resulting from litigation, restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, significant costs and expenses and reputational harm. for example, we have experienced incidents in which customers' information has been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws or regulations. attacks on our internal it systems could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. although we seek to prevent and detect attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our it systems, our it and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or other disruptions. moreover, until we have migrated businesses we acquire on to our it systems, we may face additional risks because of the continued use of predecessor it systems. we have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain support services to third parties, which may subject our it and other sensitive information to additional risk. a successful breach of the security of our it systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense. as of december 31, 2019, we operated approximately 1,450 facilities worldwide, including over 650 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances, local authorities may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. a significant aspect of the integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire is the process of making investments in the acquired facilities to conform such facilities to our standards of operations. this process is complex and time-consuming. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. changes to environmental laws and standards may increase the cost to operate some of our businesses. furthermore, if we fail to meet our commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. this could impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock. changes in environmental laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase compliance costs or impose limitations on our operations. for example, our emergency generators at our data centers are subject to regulations and permit requirements governing air pollutants, and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning and fire suppression systems at some of our data centers and data management locations may include ozone-depleting substances that are subject to regulation. while environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon operations at our facilities, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, could result in unexpected costs, which could be material. furthermore, we have made a commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy. if we are not successful in this transition, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. this could negatively impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock. 9 table of contents failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. for example, the success of our significant acquisitions depends, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with ours. to realize these anticipated benefits, we must be able to successfully integrate our business and the acquired businesses, and this integration is complex and time-consuming. we may encounter challenges in the integration process including the following: challenges and difficulties associated with managing our larger, more complex, company; conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation and benefits structures between the two businesses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with an acquisition; and our ability to deliver on our strategy going forward. further, our acquisitions subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at an acquired company, some of which may be unknown. although we and our advisors conduct due diligence on the operations of businesses we acquire, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of an acquired company. these liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to an acquired company not known to us or that we may deem immaterial or unlikely to occur at the time of the acquisition, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, information, or other items stored with us. our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage (such as per cubic foot) and our liability for igds, data center, destruction and other services unrelated to records, information and other items stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large customers and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and related service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. moreover, as we expand our operations in storage of fine arts and other valuable items and respond to customer demands for higher limitation of liability as a result of regulatory changes, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms or with high enough coverage amounts to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. 10 table of contents international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2019, we operated in approximately 50 countries outside the united states. our international operations account for a significant portion of our overall operations, and as part of our growth strategy, we expect its share to increase as we continue to acquire or invest in businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us in foreign countries where we operate; in particular, we are subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties and changes in the global political climate or other global events, such as the recent trade wars involving the u.s. or global pandemics, which may impose restrictions on, or create additional risk in relation to, global operations; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; our operations in the united kingdom and the european union may be adversely affected by the exit from the european union ( brexit ) by the united kingdom, and the uncertainty associated therewith; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. we have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which primarily transact in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts may fluctuate because of exchange rate fluctuations. 11 table of contents significant costs or disruptions at our data centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. since 2017, we have substantially expanded our global data center business through acquisitions and organically and we expect to continue to grow our global data center business in both ways going forward. for example, we paid an aggregate cash purchase price of over $1.7 billion for data center businesses we acquired in 2017 and 2018 and incurred other costs associated with the development of real estate to support this business. our global data center business depends on providing customers with highly reliable facilities, power infrastructure and operations solutions, and we will need to retain and hire qualified personnel to manage our data centers. service interruptions or significant equipment damage could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitment obligations that we owe to certain of our customers. service interruptions or equipment damage may occur at one or more of our data centers because of numerous factors, including: human error; equipment failure; physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; fire, hurricane, flood, earthquake and other natural disasters; water damage; fiber cuts; extreme temperatures; power loss or telecommunications failure; war, terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and sabotage and vandalism. in addition, climate change may increase the likelihood that our data centers are affected by some of these factors. while these risks could impact our overall business, they could have a more significant impact on our global data center business, where w e have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. as a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. because our data centers are critical to many of our customers' businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. our global data center business is susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations on the availability of adequate power resources. we rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers. we are therefore subject to an inherent risk that such third parties may fail to deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. if the power delivered to our data centers is insufficient or interrupted, we would be required to provide power through the operation of our on-site generators, generally at a significantly higher operating cost. additionally, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy, and we may be limited in our ability to, or may not always choose to, pass these increased costs on to our customers. we also rely on third party telecommunications carriers to provide internet connectivity to our customers. these carriers may elect not to offer or to restrict their services within our data centers or may elect to discontinue such services. furthermore, carriers may face business difficulties, which could affect their ability to provide telecommunications services or the quality of such services. if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. events such as these may also impact our reputation as a data center provider which could adversely affect our results of operations. our data center expansion requires a significant amount of capital and, if we are not able to raise that capital on advantageous terms, our ability to fund our data center expansion may be limited. our data center expansion requires significant capital commitments. in addition, we may be required to commit significant operational and financial resources in connection with the organic growth of our global data center business, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have enough customer demand to support these data centers when they are built. there can be no assurance we will have sufficient customer demand to support these data centers or data centers we have acquired or that we will not be adversely affected by the risks noted above, which could make it difficult for us to realize expected returns on our investments, if any. 12 table of contents we may expand our use of joint ventures which could expose us to risks and liabilities, some of which differ from the risks and liabilities related to the operation of our wholly owned subsidiaries, and our joint venture partners on whom we may rely may have economic and business interests that are inconsistent with our business interests. as part of our growth strategy we may expand our use of joint ventures, particularly in connection with our data center expansion. these joint ventures could result in our acquisition of non-controlling interests in, or shared responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property or portfolio of properties, business, partnership, joint venture or other entity. as a result, in connection with pursuing or entering into any new joint ventures, we may be subject to additional risks, including: we may not have the right to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties, business, partnership, joint venture or other entity; if our partners become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, we may choose or be required to contribute such capital; our partners may have economic, tax or other interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals, and that could affect our ability to negotiate satisfactory joint venture terms, to operate the property or business or maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit; our partners may be subject to different laws or regulations than us, or may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and/or affect our ability to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit; our partners may take actions that are not within our control, which could require us to dispose of the joint venture asset, transfer it to a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs") in order for us to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit, or purchase such partner's interests or assets at an above-market price; in connection with our joint ventures, we may agree to restrictions on our ability to expand our business in certain geographies independently or with other partners; disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day business; and we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or guarantee all or a portion of the joint venture's liabilities, which may require the company to pay an amount greater than its investment in the joint venture. each of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses, and our financial and operating results may be adversely affected. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position and reputation. having the united states government as a customer subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims because of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america, asia and australia have historically been our primary areas of focus for international expansion of our records and information management services business, with expansion of our records and information management services business into africa and the middle east and expansion of our data center and adjacent business operations becoming more of a focus recently. we have entered into joint ventures or have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services and data center businesses operating in these areas and may enter into joint ventures and/or acquire other storage and information management services, data center or adjacent businesses in the future, including in new countries or markets where we currently do not operate. a changing global political climate may impose restrictions on our ability to expand internationally. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. 13 table of contents we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and we expect this trend to continue due to climate change. some of our key facilities worldwide are vulnerable to severe weather events. damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our it systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper for recycling. further, significant declines in the cost of paper may continue to negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. 14 table of contents the performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, while controlling our labor costs. we are highly dependent on skilled and qualified personnel to operate our businesses. the failure to attract and retain qualified employees or to effectively control our labor costs could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results. our ability to control labor costs and attract qualified personnel is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wages, labor shortages, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages and hours, labor relations, immigration, healthcare and other benefits, other employment-related costs and the hiring practices of our competitors. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple businesses in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. in addition, if we are successful in winning customers from competitors, the process of moving their stored records into our facilities is often costly and time consuming. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. we have guaranteed certain obligations of recall to brambles relating to brambles' prior demerger transaction. on december 18, 2013, brambles limited, an australian corporation ("brambles"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of recall holdings limited ("recall") to brambles' shareholders (the demerger ). prior to and in connection with the demerger, brambles spun off certain of its united states and canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to recall. such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under united states and canadian tax laws, respectively, and brambles obtained rulings from the united states internal revenue service (the "irs") (with respect to the united states spin-off) and the canada revenue agency (with respect to the canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. however, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such united states subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such united states subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off. in connection with the demerger, recall agreed to indemnify brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by recall (e.g., an acquisition of recall shares) resulted in the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for united states or canadian tax purposes, respectively. in addition, recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the united states spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin- offs failing to be tax-free under united states federal income tax law or canadian tax law, respectively. recall has obtained such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by recall and us. such opinions do not affect recall's obligation to indemnify brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs. we have guaranteed the foregoing indemnification obligations of recall. consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that our acquisition of recall is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the united states spin-off or the canadian spin-off, respectively. however, if the irs or the canadian revenue agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material. 15 table of contents risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2019, our total long-term debt was approximately $8.8 billion, stockholders equity was approximately $1.5 billion and we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of approximately $193.6 million. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our global data center business and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of our various indebtedness; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; and inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing. we are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. our credit agreement (as defined in note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report) and our indentures contain customary restrictive covenants and financial restrictions on us, including a maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio of 6.5 (subject to certain exceptions) under the credit agreement and a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 6.5 (subject to certain exceptions) under certain of our indentures. as of december 31, 2019, our leverage ratio under our indentures was 5.9 . in addition, potential changes to, or the elimination of, the london interbank offered rate may adversely affect interest expense related to borrowings under the credit agreement and interest rate swaps, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition. despite our current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. the terms of our indentures generally do not cap the maximum amount of additional funds that may be borrowed under our credit agreement and possible future credit arrangements. restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our indentures and our credit agreement contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; sell, transfer or exchange assets; guarantee certain indebtedness; make acquisitions and other investments; and enter into partnerships and joint ventures. these restrictions and our long-term commitment to reduce our leverage ratio may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. 16 table of contents we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control," as defined in our indentures, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of any outstanding notes or that restrictions in our credit agreement will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain incorporated ("imi") is a holding company, and, therefore, its ability to make payments on its various debt obligations depends in large part on the operations of its subsidiaries. imi is a holding company; substantially all of its assets consist of the equity in its subsidiaries, and substantially all of its operations are conducted by its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries. as a result, its ability to make payments on its debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries, whose ability to distribute funds may be limited by local capital requirements, joint venture structures and other applicable restrictions. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by imi's u.s. subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its u.s. operations. risks related to our taxation as a reit if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. we have elected to be taxed as a reit since our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply. qualification for taxation as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable reit provisions. if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and we would not be eligible to elect reit status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a reit. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced. as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax. we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. 17 table of contents to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code. we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if our financial condition or the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements and our commitment to investors on dividend growth may result in increasing our financing needs to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit ratings, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks related to our indebtedness." see also risks related to our common stock for certain risks related to our issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities. complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility, cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities that we would otherwise pursue to execute our growth strategy, or otherwise reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. this may restrict our ability to enter into joint ventures or acquire minority interests of companies. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing. we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. in addition, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. these limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss. if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we generally must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a reit. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets or to forgo our pursuit of otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 18 table of contents as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss. our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space or colocation or wholesale data center space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability. in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements. our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. our operations include an extensive use of trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. further, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could also affect the value of our foreign holdings in our trss, negatively impacting our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes, including taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit. our information management services businesses, several of our international operations and certain of our other businesses are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or trss. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. we will also be subject to a federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate (currently 21%) on gains we recognize within a specified period from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as an asset that we hold in one of our qualified reit subsidiaries ("qrss") following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this 21% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. in addition, any depreciation recapture income that we recognize because of accounting method changes that we make in connection with our acquisition activities will be fully subject to this 21% tax. 19 table of contents complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non- united states operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges, do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them and may expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future income or gain in the trss. distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates. dividends payable by united states corporations to noncorporate stockholders, such as individuals, trusts and estates, are generally eligible for reduced united states federal income tax rates applicable to qualified dividends. distributions paid by reits generally are not treated as qualified dividends under the code, and the reduced rates applicable to such dividends do not generally apply. however, for tax years beginning before 2026, reit dividends paid to noncorporate stockholders are generally taxed at an effective tax rate lower than applicable ordinary income tax rates due to the availability of a deduction under the code for specified forms of income from passthrough entities. more favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends, which may cause some investors to perceive that an investment in a reit is less attractive than an investment in a non-reit entity that pays dividends, thereby reducing the demand and market price of our common stock. the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year. in addition, pursuant to attribution rules under the code, we are treated as the owner of each affiliate of any person who owns 10% or more of our outstanding shares; if such an affiliate is a customer and we are treated under these attribution rules as owning 10% or more of the vote or value of such customer, rents from that "affiliated tenant" will not qualify as qualifying reit income. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a reit from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. 20 table of contents legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. at any time, the federal or state income tax laws governing reits, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury (the "treasury") and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of trss, particularly non-united states trss. we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. risks related to our common stock sales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. in october 2017, we entered into a distribution agreement (the distribution agreement ) with a syndicate of 10 banks (the agents ) pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common stock through the agents (the at the market (atm) equity program ). as of december 31, 2019, we have sold 1,754,539 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $68.8 million under the at the market (atm) equity program. see note 12 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. sales or issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities could negatively impact our existing stockholders. future sales or issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of any potential issuances of equity securities, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders. furthermore, we are committed to growing our dividends, and have stated this publicly. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and related services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate and we may not be able to meet our public commitments with respect to dividend growth. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 67 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2019 relate to cash and cash equivalents held in money market funds with seven "triple a" rated money market funds. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of 1% of the fund total assets or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. as of december 31, 2019 , our cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash, was $193.6 million . interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we may use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. in march 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate indebtedness. as of december 31, 2019, we had $350.0 million in notional value of interest rate swap agreements outstanding, which expire in march 2022. under the interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable rate interest payments associated with the notional amount of each interest rate swap, based upon one-month libor, in exchange for the payment of fixed interest rate payments (at the fixed interest rate specified in the interest rate swap agreements). in july 2019, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our floating rate indebtedness once our current interest rate swaps expire in march 2022. the forward-starting interest rate swap agreements have $350.0 million in notional value, commence in march 2022 and expire in march 2024. under the swap agreements we will receive variable rate interest payments based upon one-month libor, in exchange for the payment of fixed interest rate payments at the rates specified in the interest rate swap agreements. we have designated these interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. as of december 31, 2019 , we had $1,692.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 3.8%, and $7,059.0 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2019 , approximately 81% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2019 would have been reduced by approximately $18.6 million . 67 table of contents see note 3 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion on our interest rate swaps and note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2019 . currency risk our international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real and the australian dollar. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada, australia, latin america and continental europe. im uk has financed a portion of its capital needs through the issuance in british pounds sterling of the gbp notes due 2025. our australian business has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in australian dollars under the aud term loan. similarly, iron mountain canada operations ulc has financed a portion of its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and through the issuance of the cad notes due 2023. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we designated a portion of the euro notes as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $6.0 million ( $6.0 million net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december 31, 2019. as of december 31, 2019 , cumulative net gains of $20.3 million , net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. in august 2019, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements to hedge the variability of exchange rate impacts between the united states dollar and the euro. under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements we notionally exchanged approximately $110.0 million at an interest rate of 6.0% for approximately 99.1 million euros at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.65% . the cross-currency swap agreements, which expire in august 2023, are designated as a hedge of net investment against certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries and require an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. the cross-currency swaps are marked to market at each reporting period and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net. unrealized gains are recognized as assets while unrecognized losses are recognized as liabilities. at december 31, 2019, we had a derivative liability of $1.0 million , which was recorded as a component of other within other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheet, which represents the fair value of the cross-currency swap agreements. we have recorded unrealized losses of $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. 68 table of contents as of december 31, 2019 , we had no outstanding forward contracts. at the maturity of any forward contract, we may enter into a new forward contract to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from any forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated any of the forward contracts we have entered as hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2019 , cash payments included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts were $0.7 million . we recorded net losses in connection with forward contracts of $0.7 million related to the forward contracts in other expense (income), net as of december 31, 2019 in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2019 , except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $257.8 million.quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. interest rate risk in december 2000, january 2001 and may 2001, we and variable interest entities which we now consolidate entered into a total of four derivative financial contracts, which are variable-for-fixed swaps consisting of (a) two contracts for interest payments payable on our term loan of an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million, (b) one contract for interest payments payable (previously certain variable operating lease commitments payable) on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $47.5 million and (c) one contract for interest payments payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies" in this form 10-k. after consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of december 31, 2002, we had $225.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.5%, and $1,506.3 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. over 85% of our total debt outstanding is fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, such increase would have had a negative impact on our net income for the year ended december 31, 2002 by $1.3 million. see note 5 to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2002. currency risk our investments in iron mountain europe limited, iron mountain south america, ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the canadian dollar and british pound sterling. the currencies of many latin american countries have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation in the past, including the argentine peso. in addition, one of our canadian subsidiaries, iron mountain canada corporation, has u.s. dollar denominated debt. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in the u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and iron mountain and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have attempted to limit our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through borrowings of canadian dollars in the u.s. at a level that approximates the u.s. dollar denominated borrowings of iron mountain canada corporation. however, our currency exposures to intercompany borrowings are unhedged. at december 31, 2002, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency hedging contracts. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict

unhedged, except as discussed below. we provided the initial financing to ime for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the european operations of hays ims using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. in order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing ime with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of hay ims, we borrowed 80.0 million british pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. additionally, on july 16, 2003 we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million british pounds sterling. these swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million british pounds sterling. we have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of

$275.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 5.1%, and $2,202.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2004, 89% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2004 would have been reduced by $1.5 million. see note 5 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2004. currency risk our investments in ime, iron mountain canada corporation ("im canada"), iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, imsa and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u..s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the canadian dollar and british pound sterling. the currencies of many latin american countries, particularly the argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and 47 depreciation. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and iron mountain and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the u.s. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics, while we arrange permanent financing. we have implemented these strategies for our two major foreign investments in the u.k. and canada. specifically, through ime borrowing under the ime credit agreement and our 150 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes, which effectively hedges most of our outstanding intercompany loan with ime. with respect to canada, in august 2004, we repaid the remaining $98.7 million of real estate term loans by having im canada draw on its portion of the imi revolving credit facility in local currency and repaying a portion of its intercompany loan back to the u.s. parent. this has created a natural hedge on a portion of the intercompany balance and will reduce our currency fluctuations with regard to our investment in im canada while providing im canada with additional borrowings and interest expenses to reduce its income tax burden. as of december 31, 2004, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items" component of shareholders' equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2004 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our shareholders' equity of approximately $20 million.risk factors 14 risk factors." you should not

development of business. we believe we are the global leader in information protection and storage services. we help organizations around the world reduce the costs and risks associated with information protection and storage. we offer comprehensive records management and data protection solutions, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain is a trusted partner to more than 100,000 corporate clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific. we have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 93% of the fortune 1000 and more than 90% of the ftse 100. as of december 31, 2007, we provided services in 37 countries on five continents, employed over 20,000 people and operated over 1,000 records management facilities. now in our 57th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information protection and storage services to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of $2.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2007. our growth between 1995 and 2000 was accomplished primarily through the acquisition of u.s. information protection and storage services companies. in 2001, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. this has been the case in each year since 2001 with the exception of 2004, when revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded internal revenue growth due primarily to the acquisition of the records management operations of hays plc ("hays ims") in july 2003. in the absence of unusual acquisition activity, we expect to achieve most of our revenue growth internally in 2008 and beyond. in 2007, our u.s. physical businesses were supplemented by two significant acquisitions: archivesone, inc. ("archivesone") in may and rms services usa, inc. ("rms") in september. in december 2007 our digital business was supplemented by the acquisition of stratify inc. ("stratify"). prior to 2007, we completed two significant digital acquisitions: connected corporation ("connected") in november 2004 and livevault corporation ("livevault") in december 2005. we expect our digital acquisitions will be of two primary types, those that bring us new or improved technologies to enhance our existing technology portfolio and those that increase our market position through technology and established revenue streams. we expect to achieve our internal revenue growth objectives primarily through a sophisticated sales and account management coverage model designed to drive incremental revenues by acquiring new customer relationships and increasing business with new and existing customers by selling them our products and services in new geographies and selling additional products and services such as secure shredding, digital data protection, document management services and ediscovery services. these selling efforts will be augmented and supported by an expanded marketing program, which includes product management as a core discipline. we are also developing an extensive worldwide network of channel partners through which we are selling a wide array of technology solutions, primarily our digital data protection and recovery products and services. 1 b. description of business. overview our information protection and storage services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management, data protection and recovery, and information destruction. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in each of these categories. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. our physical records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements, implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. our technology-based records management services are comprised primarily of digital archiving and related services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of electronic records. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy and financial services. our physical data protection &amp; recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. our technology-based data protection &amp; recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions (also known as electronic vaulting) for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. our information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. secure shredding services complete the life cycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. these services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. our technology-based information destruction services include datadefense, which provides automatic, intelligent encryption of sensitive pc data and, when behaviors that are inconsistent with authorized use are detected, that data is automatically eliminated and the pc is disabled this is designed to render the data useless to unauthorized users. in addition to our core records management, data protection and recovery, and information destruction services, we sell storage materials, including cardboard boxes and magnetic media, and provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services. physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the information protection and storage services industry. inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often 2 stored off-site with and serviced by an information protection and storage services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that our physical business segments provide, our worldwide digital business segment offers electronic vaulting services as an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data they have stored with us. electronic vaulting is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. in early 2003, we announced an expansion of the electronic vaulting service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data, which is often unprotected on employee laptop and desktop personal computers. in november 2004, we acquired connected, a market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data, and in december 2005, we acquired livevault, a market leader in the backup and recovery of server data. there is a growing need for better ways of archiving electronic records for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic format, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for litigation or other needs. in addition, many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are stored and managed. to help customers meet these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving services. we have experienced increasing market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance. on december 1, 2006, changes to the federal rules of civil procedure ("frcp") were implemented; as a result, electronically stored information was explicitly defined as a separate class of discoverable information in litigation. there is no longer any ambiguity about whether digital data constitutes a "document" and businesses now have the clear responsibility to produce electronic records. in december 2007, we acquired stratify, a leading provider of ediscovery services to assist customers with managing discovery of electronic records. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. our digital services offerings are representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we offer. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) inexpensive document 3 producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (4) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) requirements to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations. we believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection, digital archiving and the management of electronic documents. consolidation of a highly fragmented industry there was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented information protection and storage services industry in north america from 1995 to 2000 and at a slower but continuing pace in recent years. most information protection and storage services companies serve a single local market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. we believe that the consolidation trend, both in north america and other regions, will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for growth, opportunities for large information protection and storage services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions. we believe that the consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in multiple cities and countries for multiple services. in particular, larger customers increasingly demand a single, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical and electronic records needs. large national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. we have made, and intend to continue to make from time to time, acquisitions of our competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators. description of our business we generate our revenues by providing storage for both physical and electronic records in a variety of information media formats, core records management, data protection &amp; recovery, and information destruction services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. providing outsourced information protection and storage services is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our revenue growth. core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. in our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and handling of records and documents generated by business operations. as is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature and therefore very predictable. in 2007, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 85% of our total consolidated revenues. in addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services such as performing special project work, selling records management services related products, providing fulfillment services and consulting on records management issues. these services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. these services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components. 4 our various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. in general, our north american physical business segment offers physical records management services, including business records management, healthcare information services, vital records services, physical data protection &amp; recovery services, service and courier operations, secure shredding, fulfillment and consulting services, in the u.s. and canada. our international physical business segment offers elements of our physical product and services lines outside the u.s. and canada. our worldwide digital business segment includes our online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, digital archiving services, ediscovery services, intellectual property management services and electronic information destruction services. some of our complementary services and products are offered within all of our segments. the amount of revenues derived from our north american physical business, international physical business and worldwide digital business operating segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. service offerings business records management the hard copy business records stored by our customers by their nature are not very active. these records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer. we use a proprietary order processing and inventory management system known as the safekeeperplus&reg; system to efficiently store and later retrieve a customer's cartons. storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security. healthcare information services healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions. medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. vital records services vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information. vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. we provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations. physical data protection &amp; recovery services physical data protection &amp; recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, back-up tapes are then rotated 5 from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we use various proprietary information technology systems such as medialink , securesync and securebase software to manage this process. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. service and courier operations service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media including paper and certain records on magnetic media. they include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage, destruction of records and the rotation of back-up computer media. service charges are generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. the safekeeperplus system controls the service processes from order entry through transportation and invoicing for business records management while the medialink and securebase systems manage the process for the physical data protection services business. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2007, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,500 owned or leased vehicles. secure shredding secure shredding is a natural extension of our hardcopy records management services, completing the life cycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. these services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers in all of our existing markets throughout the u.s., canada and u.k. document management solutions the focus of our document management solutions ("dms") is to develop, implement and support comprehensive document management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. dms complements our core physical and digital service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings by providing solutions that integrate and extend our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents a tremendous opportunity for us. in addition to our existing archival storage services, there is increased opportunity to manage all active records. dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new edm solutions. electronic vaulting services electronic vaulting is our web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. customers use our connected&reg; backup for pc software product for electronic vaulting of desktop or laptop computer data and our livevault&reg; server data backup and recovery 6 product for electronic vaulting of server data. customers can choose our off-site hosted software as a service solution or they can license the software from us as part of a customer on-site solution. digital archiving services our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. these services represent the digital analogy to our physical records management services. because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, such as the changes to the frcp that explicitly define electronically stored information as a separate class of discoverable information, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management policies and retention schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions. the growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. discovery services our discovery services comprise a set of individual services and bundled solutions designed to address the legal discovery and corporate governance needs of our customers. those services and solutions allow our customers to collect, prepare, process, review, and produce data that may exist in either paper or digital form in response to internal investigations, litigations or regulatory requests. electronic discovery ("ediscovery") is the component of legal discovery involving information that is converted into digital data or collected and processed in that form. our ediscovery services, principally embodied by the stratify&reg; legal discovery application, help our customers identify, organize, analyze, and review particularly relevant or responsive information from within the universe of electronic data generated during the normal course of their business. the ability of current content management technologies to capture and maintain several copies of documents including different versions of working drafts underscores the challenges companies face in managing information for ediscovery. our consolidated suite of physical and digital discovery services has been designed to deliver a secure, end-to-end chain-of-custody, while also reducing both risks and costs for our customers. intellectual property management services our intellectual property management consist primarily of third party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code. in addition, we assist in securing intellectual property as collateral for lending, investments and joint ventures, in managing domain name registrations and transfers, and in providing expertise and assistance to brokers and dealers in complying with electronic records regulations of the sec. complementary services and products we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally 7 include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. other complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in information protection and storage services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. we also sell: (1) a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard, metal and plastic storage containers; (2) magnetic media products including computer tapes, cartridges and drives, tape cleaners and supplies and cds; and (3) computer room equipment and supplies such as racking systems and furniture. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting operating income before depreciation and amortization ("oibda") allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. for a more detailed definition and reconciliation of oibda and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures." our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase consolidated oibda in relation to capital invested, even as our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed, for which we typically receive a service fee, we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 76 consecutive quarters. for each of the five years 2003 through 2007, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 54% or more of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and oibda. historically non-cyclical storage business. we have not experienced any significant reductions in our storage business as a result of past economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be the case in the future. we believe that companies that have outsourced records management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with switching vendors or moving their records management services programs in-house. however, during a recent economic slowdown, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower 8 rate. for each of the five years 2003 through 2007, total net volume growth in north america has ranged between 6% and 8%. inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have on average generated additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. we estimate that inherent growth from existing customers represents approximately half of our total net volume growth, excluding acquisitions, in north america. we believe the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; and (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of information protection and storage services. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2007, we had over 100,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 93% of the fortune 1000 and 90% of the ftse 100. no customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. for each of the three years 2005 through 2007, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 2%. capital expenditures related primarily to growth. our information protection and storage business requires limited annual capital expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. for the years 2005 through 2007, over 85% of our aggregate capital expenditures were growth-related investments, primarily in storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. these growth-related capital expenditures are primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues and oibda. since shifting our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our capital expenditures, made primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have generally exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we paid. this was not the case in 2003 due to the acquisition of hays ims, in 2004 due to the acquisition of connected and the 49.9% equity interest held by mentmore plc ("mentmore") in iron mountain europe limited ("ime") and 2007 due to the acquisitions of archivesone and stratify. we expect this trend to continue in the future absent unusual acquisition activity. growth strategy our objective is to maintain a leadership position in the information protection and storage services industry around the world, protecting and storing our customers' information without regard to media format or geographic location. in the u.s. and canada, we seek to be one of the largest information protection and storage services providers in each of our markets. internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information protection and storage services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. our primary avenues of growth are: (1) increased business with existing customers; (2) the addition of new customers; (3) the introduction of new products and services such as secure shredding, electronic vaulting, ediscovery and dms; and (4) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets. growth from existing customers our existing customers storing physical records contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because on average they generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing 9 customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our customer base and selling additional records management, data protection &amp; recovery and information destruction services, in new and existing markets, within our existing customer relationships. we also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. services include records tracking, indexing, customized reporting, vital records management and consulting services. addition of new customers our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue from existing customers; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. introduction of new products and services we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. we have established a national presence in the secure shredding industry in the u.s., canada and the u.k. and offer our electronic vaulting management services worldwide. these new products and services allow us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth through acquisitions the goals of our current acquisition program are: to supplement internal growth in our physical businesses by continuing to establish a footprint in targeted international markets and adding fold-in acquisitions both in the u.s. and internationally; and to accelerate our leadership and time to market in our digital businesses. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating information protection and storage services companies. since january 1, 1996, when we began our acquisition program, we have completed more than 200 acquisitions in north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific for total consideration of over $3.6 billion, including approximately $1 billion associated with our merger with pierce leahy corp. ("pierce leahy") in february 2000. we substantially completed our geographic expansion in north america, europe and latin america by 2003 and began our expansion into asia pacific in 2005. acquisitions in the u.s. and canada we intend to continue our acquisition program in the u.s. and canada focusing primarily on expanding geographically as necessary and building scale in some of our smaller markets through "fold-in" acquisitions. however, given the small number of large acquisition prospects and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to overall u.s. and canadian revenue growth. international acquisition strategy we also intend to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information protection and storage services businesses outside the u.s. and canada. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information protection and storage services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe there is sufficient demand from existing multinational customers or the potential for significant growth. since beginning our international 10 expansion program in january 1999, we have directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 36 countries in europe, latin america and asia pacific. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of the entire business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate u.s. and canadian acquisition candidates, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international acquisition strategy. as a result, we have formed joint ventures with, or acquired significant interests in, target businesses throughout europe, latin america and asia pacific. we began our international expansion by acquiring a 50.1% controlling interest in each of our ime, iron mountain south america, ltd. ("imsa") and sistemas de archivo corporativo (a mexican limited liability company) subsidiaries. in 2006, we established a majority-owned joint venture serving four major markets in india, completed minority investments in information protection and storage businesses with operations in poland and russia, and in 2007, we established a majority-owned joint venture in asia pacific for consideration of approximately $2 million giving us an initial presence in singapore, hong kong-sar, china, indonesia, sri lanka, taiwan and malaysia. we believe this strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partner benefits from our expertise in the information protection and storage services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partner's knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each such business. to that end, in february 2004, we acquired the remaining 49.9% minority equity interest in ime, in january 2005, we acquired the remaining 49.9% minority equity interest in imsa and in april 2006, we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our mexican operations. in addition, we have bought out partnership interests, in whole or in part, in chile, eastern europe and the netherlands. as a result of these transactions we own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we derived approximately 28%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we have long-lived assets of approximately 31%, 33% and 34%, respectively, from outside of the u.s. digital growth and technology innovation strategy similar to our physical businesses, we seek to grow revenues in our worldwide digital segment by selling our products and services to existing and new customers. our focus on technology innovation allows us to bring leading products and services to market designed to solve customer problems in the areas of data protection and e-records management. our approach to innovation has three major components: build, buy and partner. we will build or develop our own technology in areas core to our 11 strategy in order to protect and extend our lead in the market. examples include, back up and archiving software as a service and data reduction technologies. our technology acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our product strategy, leadership and time to market and past examples include the connected, livevault and stratify acquisitions. finally, we are developing global technology partnerships that complement our product and service offerings, allow us to offer a complete solution to the marketplace and keep us in contact with emerging technology companies. customers our customer base is diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. as of december 31, 2007, we had over 100,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 93% of the fortune 1000 and more than 90% of the ftse 100. no customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. competition we compete with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future information protection and storage services. we compete with multiple information protection and storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively based on these factors. we also compete with other information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to the information protection and storage services business and such acquisition candidates or focus their strategy on our markets, our results of operations could be adversely affected. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. this storage requires significant physical space. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. we continue to invest in additional services such as electronic vaulting and e-records management, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management. employees as of december 31, 2007, we employed over 11,600 employees in the u.s. and over 8,500 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2007, an aggregate of 585 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia, new york and three cities in canada. all non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. in 12 addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. however, as of december 31 2007, certain of our labor contracts had expired, and we were operating under the expired contracts while attempting to negotiate replacement agreements. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. separate excess policies for insurer defined critical earthquake zone exposures are maintained at what we believe to be appropriate limits and deductibles for that exposure. included among other types of insurance that we carry, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles are: medical, workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal and directors and officers liability policies. in 2002, we established a wholly-owned vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary; through the subsidiary we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits or supplemental insurance arrangements. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. 13 we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. reincorporation on may 27, 2005, iron mountain incorporated, a pennsylvania corporation ("iron mountain pa"), reincorporated as a delaware corporation. the reincorporation was effected by means of a statutory merger (the "merger") of iron mountain pa with and into iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation ("iron mountain de"), a wholly owned subsidiary of iron mountain pa. in connection with the merger, iron mountain de succeeded to and assumed all of the assets and liabilities of iron mountain pa. apart from the change in its state of incorporation, the merger had no effect on iron mountain pa's business, board composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or liabilities, or location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation of management or other employees. the merger was approved at the annual meeting of stockholders held on may 26, 2005. upon consummation of the merger, iron mountain de succeeded to iron mountain pa's reporting obligations and continued to be listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol "irm." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "investor relations" section on our internet website, we make available through a hyperlink to a third party website, free of charge, our annual report on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on form 10-k. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees are also available under the investor relations section of our internet website and also may be obtained free of charge by writing to our secretary, iron mountain incorporated, 745 atlantic avenue, boston, massachusetts, 02111 and are available on our website www.ironmountain.com under the heading "corporate governance." item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. operational risks governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, most states have adopted breach of data security statutes and regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security 14 numbers, is breached; other states are currently considering such legislation. in addition, the united states congress is considering several bills that are intended to address data security through various methods that include requiring notification to affected persons of breaches of data security. our information security practices have been the subject of review or inquiry by governmental agencies, and we may be subject to additional reviews or inquiries of governmental agencies in the future. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. in addition, the increased emphasis on information security is leading customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information. as a result of these legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. we face competition for customers. we compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use an outside company, such as our company, for their future information protection and storage services needs. we also compete, in both our physical and digital businesses, with multiple information protection and storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we may not be able to effectively operate and expand our digital businesses. we operate certain digital information storage and protection businesses and are implementing a planned expansion into other digital businesses. our participation in these markets poses certain unique risks. for example, we may be unable to: raise the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these markets; 15 successfully acquire and integrate businesses or technologies to complement our current service offerings; keep up with rapid technological changes, evolving industry expectations and changing customer requirements; develop, hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise; accurately predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or compete effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise, capital or other necessary resources. in addition, the digital solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise, as well as the hardware and software products we need to complement our services, may not perform as expected. our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our businesses. because our physical businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because of customers' acceptance of other storage technologies; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. 16 some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2007, we provided services in 36 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information protection and storage services businesses in foreign markets. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. we may be subject to claims that our technology, particularly with respect to digital services, violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights, including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, to ideas, materials, processes names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use, especially in our digital business. third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that these intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. risks relating to our common stock no history of dividend payments we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. we may retain future earnings, if any, for the development of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock in the foreseeable future. any determinations by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future or repurchase our common stock will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. the terms of our credit 17 agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations. risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the following table shows important credit statistics as of december 31, 2007: at december 31, 2007 (dollars in millions) total long-term debt $ 3,266.3 stockholders' equity $ 1,795.5 debt to equity ratio 1.82 x our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information protection and storage services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. 18 we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. in addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. since iron mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. acquisition and international expansion risks failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our businesses, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations. the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. nor can we assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of iron mountain or our acquisitions. the failure to successfully integrate these cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. our growth strategy involves expanding operations into international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe and latin america have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion and we have begun our expansion into the asia pacific region. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information protection and storage services businesses operating in these areas and are actively pursuing additional opportunities. 19 this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions, or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2007, we had $829.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.8%, and $2,436.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2007, 75% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2007 would have been reduced by $5.4 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2007. 51 currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd., iron mountain new zealand ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition iron mountain switzerland gmbh and our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our four foreign investments in the u.k., continental europe, canada and asia pacific. specifically, through our 150 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the new credit agreement and its 175 million cad denominated 7 1 / 2 % senior subordinated notes due 2017. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. to fund the acquisition of pickfords in australia and new zealand in december 2005, imi borrowed australian and new zealand dollars under its multi-currency revolving credit facility. these borrowings provided a natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. subsequently, we repaid such borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility and, contemporaneously in september 2006, we entered into forward contracts to exchange u.s. dollars for 55 million in australian dollars ("aud") and 20.2 million in new zealand dollars ("nzd") to hedge our intercompany exposure in these countries. in addition, in january, 2007 we entered into forward contracts to exchange 124.4 million u.s. dollars for 96 million euros and 194 million cad for 127.5 million euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. in march 2007, in conjunction with the issuance of cad denominated senior subordinated notes, the cad for euro swap was not renewed and was replaced with additional u.s. for euro swaps. these forward contracts were not renewed in the third quarter of 2007. in the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $6.1 million ($3.9 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholder's equity for the year ended december 31, 2007. in may 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange 146.1 million u.s. dollars for 73.6 million in british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with ime. these forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we may enter into new forward 52 contracts for the same underlying amounts to continue to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. we recorded a realized gain in connection with these forward contracts of $8.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2007. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. as of december 31, 2007, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.9 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations. as of december 31, 2007, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of stockholders' equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2007 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders' equity of approximately $69.8 million.risk factors 15 risk factors." you should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements

the global leader in information protection and storage services. we help organizations around the world reduce the risks and costs associated with information protection and storage. we offer comprehensive records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain is a trusted partner to more than 120,000 corporate clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific. we have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000 and more than 90% of the ftse 100. as of december 31, 2008, we provided services in 38 countries on five continents, employed over 21,000 people and operated more than 1,000 facilities. now in our 58th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information protection and storage services to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2008. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index and we are currently number 722 on the fortune 1000. our success since becoming a public company in 1996 has been driven in large part by our execution of a consistent long-term growth plan to build market leadership by extending our strategic position through service line and global expansion. this growth plan has been sequenced into three phases. the first phase involved establishing leadership and broad market access in our core businesses: records management and data protection &amp; recovery, primarily through acquisitions. in the second phase we invested in building a successful selling organization to access new customers, converting previously unvended demand. while different parts of our business are in different stages of evolution along our three-phase strategy, as an enterprise, we have transitioned to the third phase of our growth plan, which we call the capitalization phase. in this phase, which we expect will run for a long time to come, we seek to expand our relationships with our customers to continue solving their increasingly complex information protection and storage problems. doing this well means expanding our service offerings on a global basis while maximizing our solid core businesses. in doing this, we continue to build what we believe to be a very durable business through disciplined execution. consistent with this strategy, we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of information protection and storage services companies to expansion driven primarily by internal growth. in 2001, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. this has continued to be the case in each year since 2001 with the exception of 2004. in the absence of unusual acquisition activity, we expect to achieve most of our revenue growth internally in 2009 and beyond. in 2008, we completed five small acquisitions and purchased the remaining interest of our partner in brazil. in 2007, our u.s. physical businesses were supplemented by two significant acquisitions: archivesone, inc. ("archivesone") in may and rms services usa, inc. ("rms") in september. in december 2007 our digital business was supplemented by the acquisition of stratify inc. ("stratify"). prior to 2007, we completed two significant digital acquisitions: connected corporation ("connected") in november 2004 and livevault corporation ("livevault") in december 2005. we expect our future 1 table of contents digital acquisitions will be of two primary types, those that bring us new or improved technologies to enhance our existing technology portfolio and those that increase our market position through technology and established revenue streams. we expect to achieve our internal revenue growth objectives primarily through a sophisticated sales and account management coverage model. this model is designed to drive incremental revenues by acquiring new customer relationships and increasing business with new and existing customers by selling them our products and services in new geographies and selling additional products and services such as information destruction, digital data protection, document management services and ediscovery services. we intend our selling efforts to be augmented and supported by an expanded marketing program, which includes product management as a core discipline. we also plan to continue developing an extensive worldwide network of channel partners through which we are selling a wide array of technology solutions, primarily our digital data protection and recovery products and services. b. description of business. overview our information protection and storage services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services, and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in each of these categories. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include email and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. our physical records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements, implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. included within physical records management services is document management solutions ("dms"). this suite of services helps organizations to gain better access to their paper records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information life-cycle solutions. our technology-based records management services are comprised primarily of digital archiving and related services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of electronic records. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy and financial services. our physical data protection &amp; recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. our technology-based data protection &amp; recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. our information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. secure shredding services complete the life cycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. these services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. our technology-based information destruction services include datadefense, which provides automatic, intelligent encryption of sensitive pc data and, when behaviors that are inconsistent with authorized use are detected, that data is automatically eliminated and the pc is disabled this is designed to render the data useless to unauthorized users. 2 table of contents physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the information protection and storage services industry. inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by an information protection and storage services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. in addition to our core records management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that our physical business segments provide, our worldwide digital business segment offers online backup services as an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data they have stored with us. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. in early 2003, we announced an expansion of the online backup service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data, which is often unprotected on employee laptop and desktop personal computers. in november 2004, we acquired connected, a market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data, and in december 2005, we acquired livevault, a market leader in the backup and recovery of server data. there is a growing need for better ways of archiving electronic records for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic format, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for litigation or other needs. in addition, many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are stored and managed. to help customers meet these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving services in 2003. we have experienced increasing market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance. on december 1, 2006, changes to the federal rules of civil procedure ("frcp") were implemented; as a result, electronically stored information was explicitly defined as a separate class of discoverable information in litigation. there is no longer any ambiguity about whether digital data constitutes a "document" and businesses now have the clear responsibility to produce electronic records. in december 2007, we acquired stratify, a leading provider of ediscovery services to assist customers with managing discovery of electronic records. 3 table of contents we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. our digital services offerings are representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we offer. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) requirements to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations. we believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection, digital archiving and the management of electronic documents. consolidation of a highly fragmented industry there was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented information protection and storage services industry in north america from 1995 to 2000 and at a slower but continuing pace in recent years. most information protection and storage services companies serve a single local market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. we believe that the consolidation trend, both in north america and other regions, will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for growth, opportunities for large information protection and storage services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions. we believe that the consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in multiple cities and countries for multiple services. in particular, larger customers increasingly demand a single, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical and electronic records needs. large national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. we have made, and intend to continue to make from time to time, acquisitions of our competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators. description of our business we generate our revenues by providing storage (both physical and electronic records in a variety of information media formats), core records management, data protection &amp; recovery, information destruction services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. providing outsourced information protection and storage services is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our revenue growth. core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and 4 table of contents transportation of stored records and information. in our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations. as is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature and therefore very predictable. in 2008, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 85% of our total consolidated revenues. in addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services, including special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, included in complementary services revenue is recycled paper revenues. these services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. these services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components. our various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. in general, our north american physical business and our international physical business segments offer physical records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, in their respective geographies. our worldwide digital business segment includes our online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, digital archiving services, ediscovery services, intellectual property management services and electronic information destruction services and is not limited to any particular geography. some of our complementary services and products are offered within all of our segments. the amount of revenues derived from our north american physical business, international physical business and worldwide digital business operating segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. service offerings our information protection and storage services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in each of these categories. records management services by far our largest category of services, records management services are comprised primarily of the archival storage of records, both physical and digital, for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practice. core to any records management program is the handling and transportation of those records being stored and the destruction of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. for physical records, this is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. other records management services include: compliant records management and consulting services, dms, health information management solutions, film &amp; sound archives, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. hard copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time in cartons packed by the customer with limited activity. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis and these files are typically more active. storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security. service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media. they include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage and the destruction of 5 table of contents records. service charges are generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2008, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,900 owned or leased vehicles. our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. these services represent the digital analogy to our physical records management services. because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, such as the changes to the frcp that explicitly define electronically stored information as a separate class of discoverable information, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management policies and retention schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions. the growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records management challenges. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. the focus of our dms business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive document management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. dms complements our core physical and digital service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings by providing solutions that integrate and extend our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents a tremendous opportunity for us. in addition to our existing archival storage services, there is increased opportunity to manage active records. our dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new edm solutions. we offer records management services that have been tailored for specific industries such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific needs based on the critical nature of their records. healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions. medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. we provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations. our discovery services comprise solutions designed to address the legal discovery and corporate governance needs of our customers. those services and solutions allow our customers to collect, 6 table of contents prepare, process, review, and produce data that may exist in either paper or digital form in response to internal investigations, litigation or regulatory requests. electronic discovery ("ediscovery") is the component of legal discovery involving information that is converted into digital data or collected and processed in that form. our ediscovery services, principally embodied by the stratify&reg; legal discovery application, help our customers identify, organize, analyze, and review particularly relevant or responsive information from within the universe of electronic data generated during the normal course of their business. the ability of current content management technologies to capture and maintain several copies of documents including different versions of working drafts underscores the challenges companies face in managing information for ediscovery. our consolidated suite of physical and digital discovery services has been designed to deliver a secure, end-to-end chain-of-custody, while also reducing both risks and costs for our customers. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. other complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations based on current and prospective customer orders. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. a growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by imfs. digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with the variable messages, graphics and content. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in information protection and storage services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. we also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons. in 2008 we divested ourselves of our commodity data products sales business. consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we will eliminate all revenues associated with our data products business from the calculation of our internal growth in 2008 and 2009. data protection &amp; recovery services our data protection &amp; recovery services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with regard to the off-site vaulting of data for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. as is the case with our records management services, we provide data protection &amp; recovery services for both physical and electronic records. we also offer intellectual property management services in this category. physical data protection &amp; recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to 7 table of contents secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, back-up tapes are then rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. online backup is our web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. customers use our connected&reg; backup for pc software product for online backup of desktop or laptop computer data and our livevault&reg; server data backup and recovery product for online backup of server data. customers can choose our off-site hosted software as a service solution or they can license the software from us as part of a customer on-site solution. through our intellectual property management services, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets such as software source code, object code and data in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. the result is increased control and leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage. information destruction services our information destruction services consist primarily of our physical secure shredding operations. secure shredding is a natural extension of our hardcopy records management services, completing the life cycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. these services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the u.s., canada, the u.k. and australia/new zealand. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting operating income before depreciation and amortization ("oibda") allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. for a more detailed definition and reconciliation of oibda and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures." our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase consolidated oibda in relation to capital invested, even as our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee) we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 20 consecutive years. for each of the five years 2004 through 2008, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 54% or more of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and oibda. 8 table of contents historically non-cyclical storage business. we have not experienced any significant reductions in our storage business as a result of past economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be the case in the future. we believe that companies that have outsourced records management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with switching vendors or moving their records management services programs in-house. however, during past economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. for each of the five years 2004 through 2008, total net volume growth in north america has ranged between 4% and 8%. inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have, on average, generated additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. we estimate that inherent growth from existing customers represents approximately half of our total net volume growth, excluding acquisitions, in north america. we believe the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of information protection and storage services; and (4) our positive pricing actions. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2008, we had over 120,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000 and 90% of the ftse 100. no customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. for each of the three years 2006 through 2008, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 2%. capital expenditures related primarily to growth. our information protection and storage business requires limited annual capital expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. for the years 2006 through 2008, over 85% of our aggregate capital expenditures were growth-related investments, primarily in storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. these growth-related capital expenditures are primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues and oibda. since shifting our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our capital expenditures, made primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have generally exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we paid. this was not the case in 2003 due to the acquisition of hayes plc ("hays ims"), in 2004 due to the acquisition of connected and the 49.9% equity interest held by mentmore plc ("mentmore") in iron mountain europe limited ("ime") and 2007 due to the acquisitions of archivesone and stratify. we expect this trend to continue in the future absent unusual acquisition activity. growth strategy our objective is to maintain a leadership position in the information protection and storage services industry around the world, protecting and storing our customers' information without regard to media format or geographic location. in the u.s. and canada, we seek to be one of the largest information protection and storage services providers in each of our markets. internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information protection and storage services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. we intend that our primary avenues of growth will continue to be: (1) the introduction of new products 9 table of contents and services such as secure shredding, online backup, ediscovery and dms; (2) increased business with existing customers; (3) the addition of new customers; and (4) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets. introduction of new products and services we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. adding new products and services allows us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. in 2008, we introduced two services to further help healthcare organizations meet their unique information challenges. through a new collaboration with hewlett-packard, we launched our digital record center for medical images. this service combines hp technology with our storage-as-a-service expertise to protect diagnostic images like x-rays and ct scans and provide hospitals an alternative to in-house file rooms for long-term archiving. also introduced last year was a diagnostic assessment tool that shows the nation's largest hospital systems how to process patient records more efficiently and prepare themselves for electronic health records. adopted from rms services, a healthcare records specialist we acquired in october 2007, the assessment looks at the costs of staff, third-party vendors, storage and even lost revenue from file rooms occupying space that hospitals could use for treating patients. we also enhanced our dms offerings with two new services for quickly accessing information and deriving more business value from that information. the first is the digital record center for images, a digital repository powered by ibm software for electronic scans of paper documents stored with iron mountain. we later extended this strategic relationship with ibm by integrating our accutrac&reg; software for managing paper documents with ibm's filenet records manager for electronic files. the unified offering gives companies one solution for viewing and managing both their paper and electronic documents. the company acquired accutrac in june 2007. growth from existing customers our existing customers storing physical records contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because, on average, they generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our customer base and selling additional records management, data protection &amp; recovery and information destruction services, in new and existing markets, within our existing customer relationships. we also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. services include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, included in complementary services revenue is recycled paper revenues. addition of new customers our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue from existing customers in new and existing markets; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. 10 table of contents growth through acquisitions the goals of our current acquisition program are (1) to supplement internal growth in our physical businesses by expanding our new service capabilities and industry-specific services and continuing to expand our presence in targeted international markets; and (2) to accelerate our leadership and time to market in our digital businesses. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating information protection and storage services companies. we substantially completed our geographic expansion in north america, europe and latin america by 2003 and began our expansion into asia pacific in 2005. acquisitions in the u.s. and canada given the small number of large acquisition targets in the u.s. and canada and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall u.s. and canada revenue growth. acquisitions in the u.s. and canada will likely focus primarily on expanding our dms capabilities and enhancing industry-specific services such as health information management solutions. international acquisition strategy we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information protection and storage services businesses outside the u.s. and canada. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information protection and storage services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on developing priority expansion markets in continental europe and asia, with continued leverage of our successful joint venture model. similar to our strategy in the u.s. and canada, we will also explore international acquisitions that strengthen our capabilities in areas such as dms and industry-specific services. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international expansion and acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 38 countries in europe, latin america and asia pacific. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe our joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partner benefits from our expertise in the information protection and storage services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partner's knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate u.s. and canadian acquisition candidates, when looking at an international investment or acquisition, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. in 2006, we established a majority-owned joint venture serving four major markets in india and completed minority investments in information protection and storage businesses with operations in poland and russia. in 2007, we established a majority-owned joint venture in asia pacific for consideration of approximately $2 million with operations in singapore, hong kong-sar, china, sri lanka, indonesia and taiwan. in 2007, we acquired minority interests in information and protection and storage businesses in denmark, turkey and greece. in 2008, we acquired a minority interest in an information protection and storage business in switzerland. 11 table of contents our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we made a joint venture investment. since 2005 we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our mexican operations and bought out partnership interests, in whole or in part, in chile, brazil, eastern europe and the netherlands. as a result of these transactions we own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, we derived approximately 30%, 32% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, we have long-lived assets of approximately 33%, 34% and 31%, respectively, outside of the u.s. digital growth and technology innovation strategy similar to our physical businesses, we seek to grow revenues in our worldwide digital segment by selling our products and services to existing and new customers. our focus on technology innovation allows us to bring leading products and services to market designed to solve customer problems in the areas of data protection, archiving and discovery. our approach to innovation has three major components: build, buy and partner. we intend to build or develop our own technology in areas core to our strategy in order to protect and extend our lead in the market. examples include, back up and archiving software as a service and data reduction technologies. our technology acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our product strategy, leadership and time to market and past examples include the connected, livevault and stratify acquisitions. finally, we are developing global technology partnerships that complement our product and service offerings, allow us to offer a complete solution to the marketplace and keep us in contact with emerging technology companies. customers our customer base is diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. as of december 31, 2008, we had over 120,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000 and more than 90% of the ftse 100. no customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. competition we compete with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future information protection and storage services. we also compete with multiple information protection and storage service providers in all geographic areas where we operate. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. 12 table of contents alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. this storage requires significant physical space. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. we continue to invest in additional services such as online backup and digital records management, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management. employees as of december 31, 2008, we employed over 11,400 employees in the u.s. and over 9,600 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2008, an aggregate of 550 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and three cities in canada. all non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. however, since december 31 2007, one of our labor contracts covering approximately 30 employees has expired, and we have been operating under the expired contract while attempting to negotiate a replacement agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. among other types of insurance that we carry, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles are: medical, workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal and directors and officers liability policies. in 2002, we established a wholly-owned vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary through which we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. 13 table of contents environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. reincorporation on may 27, 2005, iron mountain incorporated, a pennsylvania corporation ("iron mountain pa"), reincorporated as a delaware corporation. the reincorporation was effected by means of a statutory merger (the "merger") of iron mountain pa with and into iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation ("iron mountain de"), a wholly owned subsidiary of iron mountain pa. in connection with the merger, iron mountain de succeeded to and assumed all of the assets and liabilities of iron mountain pa. apart from the change in its state of incorporation, the merger had no effect on iron mountain pa's business, board composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or liabilities, or location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation of management or other employees. the merger was approved at the annual meeting of stockholders held on may 26, 2005. upon consummation of the merger, iron mountain de succeeded to iron mountain pa's reporting obligations and continued to be listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol "irm." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "investors" section on our internet website, we make available through a hyperlink to a third party website, free of charge, our annual report on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on form 10-k. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees may be obtained free of charge by writing to our secretary, iron mountain incorporated, 745 atlantic avenue, boston, massachusetts, 02111 and are available on the investors section of our website, www.ironmountain.com, under the heading "corporate governance." 14 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. operational risks governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states have adopted breach of data security statutes and regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. in addition, one state has adopted, and other states are considering, regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt comprehensive written information security programs, and the federal trade commission has proposed legislation intended to address data security through various methods that include requiring notification to affected persons of breaches of data security. our information security practices have been the subject of review or inquiry by governmental agencies, and we may be subject to additional reviews or inquiries of governmental agencies in the future. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. in addition, the increased emphasis on information security is leading customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the 15 table of contents interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. we face competition for customers. we compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use an outside company, such as our company, for their future information protection and storage services needs. we also compete, in both our physical and digital businesses, with multiple information protection and storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we may not be able to effectively operate and expand our digital businesses. we operate certain digital information storage and protection businesses and are implementing a planned expansion into other digital businesses. our participation in these markets poses certain unique risks. for example, we may be unable to: raise the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these markets; successfully acquire and integrate businesses or technologies to complement our current service offerings; keep up with rapid technological changes, evolving industry expectations and changing customer requirements; develop, hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise; accurately predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or compete effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise, capital or other necessary resources. in addition, the digital solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise, and the hardware and software products we need to complement our services may not perform as expected. our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. our customers may be constrained in their ability to pay for services. the current recession may cause some customers to postpone projects for which they would otherwise retain our services, and may in some instances cause customers to forgo our services. many of our largest customers are financial institutions, which have been particularly affected by the economic downturn; their condition may lead them to reduce their use of our services. in addition, a higher percentage of our customers may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, potentially affecting not only future business but also our ability to collect accounts receivable. 16 table of contents we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our businesses. because our physical businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because of customers' acceptance of other storage technologies; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2008, we provided services in 38 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information protection and storage services businesses in foreign markets. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. 17 table of contents we may be subject to claims that our technology, particularly with respect to digital services, violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights, including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use, especially in our digital business. third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that these intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates through a customer surcharge. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations while increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. these events could result in customer disruption, physical damages to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. risks relating to our common stock no history of dividend payments we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. we may retain future earnings, if any, for the development of our business or use future earnings to repay outstanding indebtedness. we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock in the foreseeable future. any determinations by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future or repurchase our common stock will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. the terms of our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations. risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the following table shows important credit statistics as of december 31, 2008: at december 31, 2008 (dollars in millions) total long-term debt $ 3,243.2 stockholders' equity $ 1,802.8 debt to equity ratio 1.80 x 18 table of contents our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information protection and storage services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. in addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. since iron mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. 19 table of contents acquisition and international expansion risks failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our businesses, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations. the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. nor can we assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of iron mountain or our acquisitions. the failure to successfully integrate these cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. our growth strategy involves expanding operations into international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe and latin america have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion and we have begun our expansion into the asia pacific region. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information protection and storage services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other information protection and storage services businesses in the future. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions, or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 20 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market funds and time deposits. as of december 31, 2008, we had significant concentration of credit risk with four global banks and four "triple a" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. as of december 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $278.4 million, which included money market funds and time deposits amounting to $203.3 million. a substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in u.s. treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2008, we had $640.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.1%, and $2,602.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2008, 80.3% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2008 would have been reduced by $4.0 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2008. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd., iron mountain new zealand ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several 53 table of contents intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition iron mountain switzerland gmbh and our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our four foreign investments in the u.k., continental europe and canada. specifically, through our 150 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and its 175 million cad denominated 7 1 / 2 % senior subordinated notes due 2017. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. in the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $10.5 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2008. in may 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange $146.1 million u.s. dollars for 73.6 million in british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with ime. these forward contracts typically settle on no more than a quarterly basis, at which time we may enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts to continue to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. we recorded a realized gain in connection with these forward contracts of $24.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2008. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. as of december 31, 2008, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $13.7 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations. as of december 31, 2008, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of stockholders' equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2008 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders' equity of approximately $59.9 million.risk factors 14 risk factors." you should not

item 1. business. a. development of business. we are a leading information management services company. we help organizations around the world reduce the risks, costs and inefficiencies associated with storing and using their physical and digital data. we offer comprehensive records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information management challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain is a trusted partner to more than 140,000 corporate clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific. we have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 97% of the fortune 1000 and more than 93% of the ftse 100. as of december 31, 2009, we provided services in 38 countries on five continents, employed over 20,000 people and operated more than 1,000 facilities. now in our 59th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information management services to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of $3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2009. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index and we are currently number 681 on the fortune 1000. our success since becoming a public company in 1996 has been driven in large part by our execution of a consistent long-term growth plan to build market leadership by extending our strategic position through service line and global expansion. this growth plan has been sequenced into three phases. the first phase involved establishing leadership and broad market access in our core businesses: records management and data protection &amp; recovery, primarily through acquisitions. in the second phase we invested in building a successful selling organization to access new customers, converting previously unvended demand. while different parts of our business are in different stages of evolution along our three-phase strategy, as an enterprise, we have transitioned to the third phase of our growth plan, which we call the capitalization phase. in this phase, which we expect will run for a long time to come, we seek to expand our relationships with our customers to continue solving their increasingly complex information management problems. doing this well means expanding our service offerings on a global basis while maximizing our solid core businesses. in doing this, we continue to build what we believe to be a very durable business through disciplined execution. consistent with this strategy, we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of information management services companies to expansion driven primarily by internal growth. in 2001, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. this has continued to be the case in each year since 2001 with the exception of 2004. in the absence of unusual acquisition activity, we expect to achieve more of our revenue growth internally in 2010 and beyond. in february, 2010, we acquired mimosa systems, inc. ("mimosa"), a leader in enterprise-class digital content archiving solutions, for approximately $112 million in cash. mimosa, based in santa clara, california, provides an on-premises integrated archive for email, sharepoint data and files, and complements our existing enterprise-class, cloud-based digital archive services. nearpoint&reg;, mimosa's enterprise archiving platform, has applications for retention and disposition, electronic discovery ("ediscovery"), compliance supervision, classification, recovery, and end-user search, enabling customers to reduce risk, and lower their ediscovery and storage costs. 1 table of contents we expect to achieve our internal revenue growth objectives primarily through a sophisticated sales and account management coverage model. this model is designed to drive incremental revenues by acquiring new customer relationships and increasing business with new and existing customers by selling them our products and services in new geographies and selling additional products and services such as information destruction, digital data protection, document management services and ediscovery services. we intend our selling efforts to be augmented and supported by expanded marketing programs, which include product management as a core discipline. we also plan to continue developing an extensive worldwide network of channel partners through which we are selling a wide array of technology solutions. our sales and account coverage model and our go-to-market strategy will continue to evolve to meet the needs of our customers. b. description of business. overview our information management services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services, and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in each of these categories. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include email and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. our physical records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements, implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. included within physical records management services is document management solutions ("dms"). this suite of services helps organizations to gain better access to and, ultimately, control over their paper records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information life-cycle solutions. our technology-based records management services are comprised primarily of digital archiving and related services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of electronic records and ediscovery services. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services. our physical data protection &amp; recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. our technology-based data protection &amp; recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer intellectual property escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. our information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. secure shredding services complete the life cycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. these services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to 2 table of contents ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the information management services industry. inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by an information management services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. in addition to our core records management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that our physical business segments provide, our worldwide digital business segment offers online backup services as an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data they have stored with us. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. in early 2003, we announced an expansion of the online backup service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data, which is often unprotected on employee laptop and desktop personal computers. in november 2004, we acquired connected corporation ("connected"), a market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data, and in december 2005, we acquired livevault corporation ("livevault"), a market leader in the backup and recovery of server data. there is a growing need for better ways of archiving electronic records for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic format, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for litigation or other needs. in addition, many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are stored and managed. to help customers meet these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving services in 2003. we have experienced increasing market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance. on december 1, 2006, changes to the federal rules of civil procedure ("frcp") were implemented; as a result, electronically stored information was explicitly defined as a separate class of discoverable information in litigation. there is no longer any ambiguity about whether digital data constitutes a "document" and businesses now have the clear responsibility to produce electronic records. in december 2007, we acquired stratify inc. ("stratify"), a leading provider of ediscovery services to assist customers with managing discovery of electronic records. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for 3 table of contents litigation support. our digital services offerings are representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we offer. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. we believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection, digital archiving and the management of electronic documents. consolidation of a highly fragmented industry there was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented physical information management services industry in north america from 1995 to 2000 and at a slower but continuing pace in recent years. most physical information management services companies serve a single local market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. we believe that the consolidation trend in the physical information management industry, both in north america and other international geographies, will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for growth, opportunities for large information management services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions. we believe that the consolidation trend in this industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in multiple cities and countries for multiple services. in particular, larger customers increasingly demand a single, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical records needs. large national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. we have made, and may continue to make from time to time, acquisitions of our competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators. description of our business we generate our revenues by providing storage (both physical and electronic records in a variety of information media formats), core records management, data protection &amp; recovery, information destruction services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. providing outsourced information management services is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our revenue growth. core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. in our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations. as is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature. in 2009, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 88% of our total consolidated revenues. in addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary 4 table of contents products and services, including special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, included in complementary services revenue is recycled paper revenues. these services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. these services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components. our various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. in general, our north american physical business and our international physical business segments offer physical records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, in their respective geographies. our worldwide digital business segment includes our online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, digital archiving services, ediscovery services and intellectual property management services and is not limited to any particular geography. some of our complementary services and products are offered within all of our segments. the amount of revenues derived from our north american physical business, international physical business and worldwide digital business operating segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. service offerings our information management services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records management and data protection &amp; recovery categories. currently, we only offer physical services in the information destruction services category. records management services by far our largest category of services, records management services are comprised primarily of the archival storage of records, both physical and digital, for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practice. core to any records management program is the handling and transportation of those records being stored and the destruction of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. for physical records, this is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. other records management services include: compliant records management and consulting services, dms, health information management solutions, film &amp; sound archives, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. hard copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time in cartons packed by the customer with limited activity. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis and these files are typically more active. storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security. service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media. they include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage and the destruction of records. service charges are generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2009, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles. 5 table of contents our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. these services represent the digital analogy to our physical records management services. because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, such as the changes to the frcp that explicitly define electronically stored information as a separate class of discoverable information, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management policies and retention schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions. the growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records management challenges. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. the focus of our dms business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive document management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. dms complements our core physical and digital service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings by providing solutions that integrate and extend our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us. in addition to our existing archival storage services, there is increased opportunity to manage active records. our dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new edm solutions. we offer records management services that have been tailored for specific industries such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific needs based on the critical nature of their records. healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions. medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. we provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations. our discovery services comprise solutions designed to address the legal discovery and corporate governance needs of our customers. those services and solutions allow our customers to collect, prepare, process, review, and produce data that may exist in either paper or digital form in response to internal investigations, litigation or regulatory requests. electronic discovery is the component of legal discovery involving information that is converted into digital data or collected and processed in that form. our ediscovery services, principally embodied by the stratify&reg; legal discovery application, help our customers identify, organize, analyze, and review 6 table of contents particularly relevant or responsive information from within the universe of electronic data generated during the normal course of their business. the ability of current content management technologies to capture and maintain several copies of documents including different versions of working drafts underscores the challenges companies face in managing information for ediscovery. our consolidated suite of physical and digital discovery services has been designed to deliver a secure, end-to-end chain-of-custody, while also reducing both risks and costs for our customers. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. other complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations based on current and prospective customer orders. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. a growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by imfs. digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with the variable messages, graphics and content. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. we also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons. in 2008 we divested ourselves of our commodity data products sales business. consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we eliminated all revenues associated with our data products business from the calculation of our internal growth in 2008 and 2009. data protection &amp; recovery services our data protection &amp; recovery services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with regard to the off-site vaulting of data for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. as is the case with our records management services, we provide data protection &amp; recovery services for both physical and electronic records. we also offer intellectual property management services in this category. physical data protection &amp; recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, back-up tapes are then rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. online backup is our web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. customers use our connected&reg; backup for pc software product for online backup of desktop or laptop computer data and our livevault&reg; server data backup and recovery product for online 7 table of contents backup of server data. customers can choose our off-site hosted software as a service solution or they can license the software from us as part of a customer on-site solution. through our intellectual property management services, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets such as software source code, object code and data in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. the result is increased control and leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage. information destruction services our information destruction services consist primarily of our physical secure shredding operations. secure shredding is a natural extension of our hardcopy records management services, completing the life cycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. these services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the u.s., canada, the u.k. and australia/new zealand. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization ("adjusted oibda") allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. for a more detailed definition and reconciliation of adjusted oibda and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures." our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee) we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 21 consecutive years. for each of the five years 2005 through 2009, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 54% or more of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and adjusted oibda. historically non-cyclical storage business. historically, we have not experienced any significant reductions in our storage business as a result of economic downturns although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. we believe that companies that have outsourced records management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with accelerating destructions of their records, switching vendors or moving their records management services programs in-house. however, during this current recession, destruction rates have increased as some customers have been more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower storage costs in the long-term. this phenomenon results in lower net volume growth rates in the short-term. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. for 8 table of contents each of the five years 2005 through 2009, total net volume growth in north america has ranged between 1% and 8%. inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have, on average, generated additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. we believe the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of information management services; and (4) our positive pricing actions. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2009, we had over 140,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 97% of the fortune 1000 and 93% of the ftse 100. no customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. for each of the three years 2007 through 2009, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 2%. capital expenditures related primarily to growth. our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our growth as well as our current operations. we believe that capital expenditures as a percent of revenues is a meaningful metric for investors as it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the internal growth of our business. for the years 2007 through 2009, our total capital expenditures as a percent of revenues were 14%, 13% and 10%, respectively. included in the total are limited annual capital expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. we define these maintenance capital expenditures to include items such as major facility repairs including life, health and safety improvements, replacement of warehouse equipment, shredding bins, and certain computer equipment (including personal computers for employees and equipment for our operations), and system conversions. for each of the years 2007 through 2009, these maintenance capital expenditures represented approximately 2% of our annual revenues. the balance of our aggregate capital expenditures were growth-related investments, primarily in storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. these growth-related capital expenditures are primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues and adjusted oibda. since shifting our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our capital expenditures in most years, made primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have generally exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we paid in the same year. this was not the case in 2007 due to the acquisitions of archivesone, inc. ("archivesone") and stratify. we expect this trend to continue in the future absent unusual acquisition activity. growth strategy our objective is to maintain a leadership position in the information management services industry around the world, protecting and storing our customers' information and enabling them to better use it without regard to media format or geographic location. in the u.s. and canada, we seek to be one of the largest information management services providers in each of our markets. internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information management services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. we intend that our primary avenues of growth will continue to be: (1) the introduction of new products and services such as secure shredding, online backup, ediscovery and dms; (2) increased business with existing customers; (3) the addition of new customers; and (4) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets. 9 table of contents introduction of new products and services we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. adding new products and services allows us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. in 2009, we introduced two new technology solutions: virtual file store ("vfs"), an enterprise-class, cloud-based digital storage archiving service and evantage , an on-premises ediscovery early case assessment solution. vfs is an on-demand, long-term storage service that reduces total cost of ownership for storing and managing static data files. as companies search for cost-effective solutions to manage large amounts of digital information, our vfs solution offers secure, long-term storage of inactive data at off-site data centers, greatly reducing the investment in an expensive on-site storage infrastructure and supporting regulatory and compliance initiatives. stratify's evantage solution safeguards corporate proprietary information and allows general counsel to reduce the cost and risk of ediscovery by going beyond statistical data culling with advanced technologies that drive more intelligent qualitative analysis on all matters and internal investigations in their ediscovery portfolio. growth from existing customers our existing customers storing physical records contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because, on average, they generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our customer base and selling additional records management, data protection &amp; recovery and information destruction services, in new and existing markets, within our existing customer relationships. we also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. services include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, included in complementary services revenue is recycled paper revenues. addition of new customers our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue from existing customers in new and existing markets; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. growth through acquisitions the goals of our current acquisition program are (1) to supplement internal growth in our physical businesses by expanding our new service capabilities and industry-specific services and continuing to expand our presence in targeted international markets; and (2) to accelerate our leadership and time to market in our digital businesses. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating information management services companies. we substantially completed our geographic expansion in north america, europe and latin america by 2003 and began our expansion into asia pacific in 2005. 10 table of contents acquisitions in the north american physical segment given the small number of attractive acquisition targets in our core physical businesses in north america and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall north american revenue growth than in the past. acquisitions in the north american physical segment will likely focus primarily on expanding our dms capabilities and enhancing industry-specific services such as health information management solutions. acquisitions in the international physical segment we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information management services businesses outside north america. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information management services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on developing priority expansion markets in continental europe and asia, with continued leverage of our successful joint venture model. similar to our strategy in north america, we will also explore international acquisitions that strengthen our capabilities in areas such as dms and industry-specific services. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international expansion and acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 36 countries in europe, latin america and asia pacific. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe our joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partner benefits from our expertise in the information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate north american acquisition candidates, when looking at an international investment or acquisition, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we made a joint venture investment. in 2008, we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our brazilian operations and we now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, we derived approximately 32%, 32% and 30%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, we have long-lived assets of approximately 34%, 31% and 34%, respectively, outside of the u.s. acquisitions in the worldwide digital segment our focus on technology innovation allows us to bring leading products and services to market designed to solve customer problems in the areas of data protection, archiving and discovery. our 11 table of contents approach to innovation includes our internal development efforts, partnering with other technology companies and acquisition of new and existing technologies. we intend to build or develop our own technology in areas core to our strategy in order to protect and extend our position in the market. examples include, back up and archiving software as a service and data reduction technologies. we are developing global technology partnerships that complement our product and service offerings, allow us to offer a complete solution to the marketplace and keep us in contact with emerging technology companies. our technology acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our product strategy, leadership and time to market and past examples include the connected (2004), livevault (2005), stratify (2007) and mimosa (2010) acquisitions. we expect our future technology acquisitions will be of two primary types, those that bring us new or improved technologies to enhance our existing technology portfolio and those that increase our market position through technology and established revenue streams. competition we compete with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future information management services. we also compete with multiple information management service providers in all geographic areas where we operate. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. this storage requires significant physical space. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. we continue to invest in additional services such as online backup and digital records management, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management. employees as of december 31, 2009, we employed over 10,500 employees in the u.s. and over 9,600 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2009, an aggregate of 518 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and five cities in canada. all non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. 12 table of contents insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. among other types of insurance that we carry, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles are: medical, workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse, legal and directors and officers liability policies. in 2002, we established a wholly-owned vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary through which we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. reincorporation on may 27, 2005, iron mountain incorporated, a pennsylvania corporation ("iron mountain pa"), reincorporated as a delaware corporation. the reincorporation was effected by means of a statutory merger (the "merger") of iron mountain pa with and into iron mountain incorporated, a delaware 13 table of contents corporation ("iron mountain de"), a wholly owned subsidiary of iron mountain pa. in connection with the merger, iron mountain de succeeded to and assumed all of the assets and liabilities of iron mountain pa. apart from the change in its state of incorporation, the merger had no effect on iron mountain pa's business, board composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or liabilities, or location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation of management or other employees. the merger was approved at the annual meeting of stockholders held on may 26, 2005. upon consummation of the merger, iron mountain de succeeded to iron mountain pa's reporting obligations and continued to be listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol "irm." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "investors" section on our internet website, we make available through a hyperlink to a third party website, free of charge, our annual report on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on form 10-k. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees are available on the investors section of our website, www.ironmountain.com, under the heading "corporate governance." item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. operational risks governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. in addition, in 2009 the united states department of health and human services adopted regulations requiring notification to persons whose personal health information is accessed by an unauthorized third party and provides for civil fines in some circumstances. one state adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in some instances european data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches. our information security practices have been the subject of review or inquiry by governmental agencies, and we may be subject to additional reviews or inquiries of governmental agencies in the future. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. for example, the united states congress is considering legislation intended to address data security through various methods that include requiring notification to affected persons of data security breaches. in 14 table of contents addition, the increased emphasis on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our digital, dms and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. we face competition for customers. we compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as our company, for their future information management services needs. we also compete, in both our physical and digital businesses, with multiple information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we may not be able to effectively operate and expand our digital businesses. we operate certain digital information management businesses and are implementing a planned expansion into other digital businesses. our participation in these markets poses certain unique risks. for example, we may be unable to: successfully acquire and integrate businesses or technologies to complement our current service offerings; keep up with rapid technological changes, evolving industry expectations and changing customer requirements; 15 table of contents compete effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise, capital or other necessary resources; develop, hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise; accurately predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or raise the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these markets. in addition, the digital solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise, and the hardware and software products we need to complement our services may not perform as expected. our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. our customers may be constrained in their ability to pay for services or require fewer services. a continued recession may cause some customers to postpone projects for which they would otherwise retain our services, and may in some instances cause customers to forgo our services. many of our largest customers are financial institutions, which have been particularly affected by the economic downturn; their condition may lead them to reduce their use of our services. in addition, a higher percentage of our customers may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, potentially affecting not only future business but also our ability to collect accounts receivable. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our businesses. because our physical businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because of customers' acceptance of other storage technologies; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial 16 table of contents activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2009, we provided services in 37 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information management services businesses in foreign markets. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. we may be subject to claims that our technology, particularly with respect to digital services, violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use, especially in our digital business. third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates through a customer surcharge. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations while increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. these events could 17 table of contents result in customer disruption, physical damages to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. risks relating to our common stock no guaranty of dividend payments or stock repurchases although our board of directors recently approved a share repurchase program and adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determinations by us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, the price of our common stock in the case of the repurchase program and our board of director's continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. the terms of our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations. risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the following table shows important credit statistics as of december 31, 2009 (dollars in millions): total long-term debt $ 3,251.8 total equity $ 2,145.2 debt to equity ratio 1.52 x our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. 18 table of contents restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. in addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. since iron mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. acquisition and expansion risks failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations. the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a 19 table of contents disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. nor can we assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of iron mountain or our acquisitions. the failure to successfully integrate these cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe and latin america have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion and we have begun our expansion into the asia pacific region. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other information management services businesses in the future. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions, or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 55 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash, money market funds and time deposits. as of december 31, 2009, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with five global banks and ten "triple a" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. as of december 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $446.7 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $381.6 million. a substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in u.s. treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. 55 table of contents as of december 31, 2009, we had $430.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 2.0%, and $2,821.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2009, 86.8% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2009 would have been reduced by $2.7 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2009. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd., iron mountain new zealand ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition iron mountain switzerland gmbh and our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the u.k., continental europe and canada. specifically, through our 150 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and its 175 million cad denominated 7 1 / 2 % senior subordinated notes due 2017. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. in the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $1.9 million ($1.0 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended december 31, 2009. as of december 31, 2009, net gains of $3.4 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. we have entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge our exposures to british pounds sterling. as of december 31, 2009, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $121.3 million u.s. dollars and sell 73.6 million in british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with ime. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of 56 table of contents operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. during the year ended december 31, 2009, there was $2.4 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net losses in connection with these forward contracts of $12.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $4.1 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2009. as of december 31, 2009, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2009 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $77.1 million.risk factors 16 risk factors." you should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may

lower the costs, risks and inefficiencies of managing their physical and digital data. our solutions enable customers to protect and better use their information regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. we offer comprehensive records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information management challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain is a trusted partner to more than 150,000 corporate clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific. we have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2010, we provided services in more than 35 countries on five continents, employed over 19,000 people and operated more than 1,000 facilities. now in our 60th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information management services to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of more than $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2010. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index and as of december 31, 2010 we were number 644 on the fortune 1000. our success since becoming a public company in 1996 has been driven in large part by our execution of a consistent long-term growth plan to build market leadership by extending our strategic position through service line and global expansion. this growth plan has been sequenced into three phases. the first phase involved establishing leadership and broad market access in our core businesses: records management and data protection &amp; recovery, primarily through acquisitions. in the second phase we invested in building a successful selling organization to access new customers, converting previously unvended demand. while different parts of our business are in different stages of evolution along our three-phase strategy, as an enterprise, we have transitioned to the third phase of our growth plan, which we call the capitalization phase. in this phase, which we expect will run for a long time to come, we seek to expand our relationships with our customers to continue solving their increasingly complex information management problems. doing this well means expanding our service offerings on a global basis while maximizing our solid core businesses. in doing this, we continue to build what we believe to be a very durable business through disciplined execution. consistent with this strategy, we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of information management services companies to expansion driven primarily by internal growth. in 2001, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. this has continued to be the case in each year since 2001 with the exception of 2004. in the absence of unusual acquisition activity, we expect to achieve more of our revenue growth internally in 2011 and beyond. we expect to achieve our long-term growth goals by offering our customers integrated services that address their increasingly complex information management needs regardless of the format, location or lifecycle stage of their information. by doing so we aim to help our customers reduce the costs, risks and complexities associated with managing their data while increasing their compliance with various laws, regulations, company policies and industry best practices. consistent with our overall growth 1 table of contents strategy, we are focused on improving our internal revenue growth trajectory in the near-term primarily through a set of specific growth initiatives. our go-to-market initiative is a targeted approach to improving our sales capability. by successfully executing on this initiative, we expect to increase revenues with our existing customers by selling them new services and by gaining new customers that today do not outsource some or all of their information management service needs. we are also targeting higher growth in our international businesses as we expand our platform for selling core services and new services in higher growth markets. finally, we are continuing to expand our services portfolio in the hybrid and digital markets to capture what we see as larger, faster growing opportunities. at this stage in our evolution we are equally focused on driving increased profitability and cash flow through a disciplined management approach and a focus on operational excellence. comprised of productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements and cost controls, our operational excellence strategy has produced significant and visible results. since 2006, we have compounded annual growth rates of 12% for adjusted operating income before depreciation, amortization and goodwill impairment ("adjusted oibda"), 18% for adjusted earnings per share and 68% for free cash flows before acquisitions and discretionary investments ("fcf"). during that same period, we reduced our capex (excluding real estate) as a percent of revenues from 13.6% in 2006, to 8.1% in 2010. for more detailed definitions and reconciliations of adjusted oibda, adjusted earnings per share and fcf and a discussion of why we believe these measure provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures." we are committed to delivering shareholder value. to that end, and supported by our increased profitability and strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in february 2010 consisting of our first ever quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share, declared in march 2010, june 2010 and september 2010, and a share repurchase authorization of up to $150.0 million. in october 2010, our board approved an increase to the amount authorized under our existing share repurchase program of up to an additional $200.0 million. in december 2010, the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1875 per share, an increase of 200% over the quarterly dividend previously paid. the increase in our dividend is the result of the success we have had as an organization driving higher profitability and strong cash flows. b. description of business. overview our information management services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services, and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in each of these categories. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include email and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. our physical records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements, implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. included within physical records management services are our hybrid services. these services help organizations to gain better access to, and ultimately control over, their paper records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information lifecycle solutions. our technology-based records management services are comprised primarily of digital 2 table of contents archiving and related services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of electronic records and ediscovery services. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services. our physical data protection &amp; recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. our technology-based data protection &amp; recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer intellectual property escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. our information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. secure shredding services complete the lifecycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. these services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the information management services industry. inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by an information management services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. in addition to our core records management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that our physical business segments provide, our worldwide digital business segment offers online backup services as an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data they have stored with us. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. in early 2003, we announced an expansion of the online backup service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data, which is often unprotected on employee laptop and desktop personal computers. in november 2004, we acquired connected corporation ("connected"), a market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data, and in 3 table of contents december 2005, we acquired livevault corporation ("livevault"), a market leader in the backup and recovery of server data. there is a growing need for better ways of archiving electronic records for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic format, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for litigation or other needs. in addition, many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are stored and managed. to help customers meet these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving services in 2003. we have experienced increasing market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance. on december 1, 2006, changes to the federal rules of civil procedure (the "frcp") were implemented, which provided that electronically stored information was a separate class of discoverable information in litigation. as a result, businesses have a clear responsibility to produce electronic records. our customers face increased need for litigation support services as a result of these changes to the frcp. we provide both litigation support and ediscovery services to our customers to help them address this challenge. in december 2007, we acquired stratify inc. ("stratify"), a leading provider of ediscovery services to assist customers with managing discovery of electronic records. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. our digital services offerings are representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we offer. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. we believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection, digital archiving and the management of electronic documents. consolidation of a highly fragmented industry there was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented physical information management services industry in north america from 1995 to 2000 and at a slower but continuing pace since then. most physical information management services companies serve a single local market and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. we 4 table of contents believe that the consolidation trend in the physical information management industry, both in north america and other international geographies, may continue because of the industry's capital requirements for growth, opportunities for large information management services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions. we believe that the consolidation trend in this industry is also due to, and may continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in multiple cities and countries for multiple services. in particular, larger customers increasingly demand a single, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical records needs. large national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. we have made, and may continue to make from time to time, acquisitions of our competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators. description of our business we generate our revenues by providing storage (both physical and electronic records in a variety of information media formats), core records management, data protection &amp; recovery, information destruction services, hybrid services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. providing outsourced information management services is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our revenue growth. core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. in our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations. additionally, core services include hybrid services, recurring project revenues and maintenance fees associated with software license sales. as is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature. in 2010, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 87% of our total consolidated revenues. in addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services, including special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, included in complementary services revenue is recycled paper revenues. these services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. these services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components. our various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. in general, our north american physical business and our international physical business segments offer physical records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, in their respective geographies. our worldwide digital business segment includes our online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, digital archiving services, ediscovery services and intellectual property management services and is not limited to any particular geography. some of our complementary services and products are offered within all of our segments. the amount of revenues derived from our north american physical business, international physical business and worldwide digital business operating segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. service offerings our information management services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records management and data protection &amp; 5 table of contents recovery categories. currently, we only offer physical services in the information destruction services category. records management services by far our largest category of services, records management services are comprised primarily of the archival storage of records, both physical and digital, for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practice. core to any records management program is the handling and transportation of those records being stored and the destruction of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. for physical records, this is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. other records management services include: our hybrid services as well as compliant records management and consulting services, health information management solutions, film &amp; sound archives, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. hard copy business records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer for long periods of time with limited activity. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis and these files are typically more active. storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security. service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media. they include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage and the destruction of records. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2010, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles. our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. these services represent the digital analogy to our physical records management services. because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, such as the changes to the frcp that explicitly define electronically stored information as a separate class of discoverable information, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management policies and retention schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions. the growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records management challenges. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. the focus of our hybrid business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our hybrid services complement our core physical and digital service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings by providing solutions that integrate and extend our existing portfolio of products and services. 6 table of contents the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us. in addition to our existing archival storage services, there is increased opportunity to manage active records. our hybrid services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new edm solutions. we offer records management services that have been tailored for specific industries such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific needs based on the critical nature of their records. healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions. medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. we provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations. our discovery services comprise solutions designed to address the legal discovery and corporate governance needs of our customers. those services and solutions allow our customers to collect, prepare, process, review, and produce data that may exist in either paper or digital form in response to internal investigations, litigation or regulatory requests. electronic discovery is the component of legal discovery involving information that is converted into digital data or collected and processed in that form. our ediscovery services, principally embodied by the iron mountain legal discovery application acquired in the stratify acquisition, help our customers identify, organize, analyze, and review particularly relevant or responsive information from within the universe of electronic data generated during the normal course of their business. the ability of current content management technologies to capture and maintain several copies of documents including different versions of working drafts underscores the challenges companies face in managing information for ediscovery. our consolidated suite of physical and digital discovery services has been designed to deliver a secure, end-to-end chain-of-custody, while also reducing both risks and costs for our customers. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. other complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations based on current and prospective customer orders. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. a growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by imfs. 7 table of contents digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with the variable messages, graphics and content. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. we also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons. we divested ourselves of our commodity data products sales business in 2008 and our domain name management product line in 2010. consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we will eliminate all revenues associated with our data products business from the calculation of our internal growth rates for 2008 and 2009 and revenues associated with our domain name management product line were eliminated from the calculation of internal growth rate for 2010 and will also be eliminated from that calculation in 2011. data protection &amp; recovery services our data protection &amp; recovery services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with regard to the off-site vaulting of data for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. as is the case with our records management services, we provide data protection &amp; recovery services for both physical and electronic records. we also offer intellectual property management services in this category. physical data protection &amp; recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, back-up tapes are then rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. online backup is our web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. customers use our connected&reg; backup for pc and mac software product for online backup of desktop or laptop computer data and our livevault&reg; server data backup and recovery product for online backup of server data. customers can choose our off-site hosted software as a service solution or they can license the software from us as part of a customer on-site solution. through our intellectual property management services, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets such as software source code, object code and data in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. the result is increased control and leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage. information destruction services our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations. secure shredding is a natural extension of our hardcopy records management services, completing the lifecycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. these services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the 8 table of contents resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the u.s., canada, the u.k., australia/new zealand and latin america. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting adjusted oibda allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 22 consecutive years. for each of the five years 2006 through 2010, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 53% or more of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and adjusted oibda. historically non-cyclical storage business. historically, we have not experienced any significant reductions in our storage business as a result of economic downturns although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. we believe that companies that have outsourced records management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with accelerating destructions of their records, switching vendors or moving their records management services programs in-house. however, during the current recession, which is more severe and has lasted longer than other recent downturns, destruction rates have increased as some customers have been more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower storage costs in the long-term. in addition, we have experienced longer sales cycles and lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment rates and generally lower levels of business activity. combined, these impacts have resulted in lower net volume growth rates in the short-term. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. for each of the five years 2006 through 2010, total net volume growth in north america has ranged from between 1% to 7%. inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have, on average, sent us additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. however, in the current economic downturn, elevated destruction and withdrawal rates have resulted in lower net volume growth in recent quarters. we believe the continued growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of information management services; and (4) our positive pricing actions. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2010, we had over 150,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000. no customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated 9 table of contents revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010. for each of the three years 2008 through 2010, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 2%. capital expenditures related primarily to business line growth and ongoing operations. our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. as the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. every year we expend capital to support a number of different objectives. the majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. these expenditures are generally smaller and more discretionary in nature. below are descriptions of the major types of capital expenditures we are likely to make in a given year: capital to support business line growth these expenditures are primarily related to capacity expansion. this includes investments in new building outfitting, carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins and technology service storage and processing capacity. capital to support ongoing business operations these expenditures are primarily related to major repairs and/or the replacement of assets such as facilities, warehouse equipment and computers, previously referred to as maintenance capital expenditures. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. capital for new product development these expenditures are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition. capital for product improvement these expenditures are primarily related to product and service enhancements that support our leadership position in the various markets in which we operate. spending in this area includes items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements. capital to support operational efficiencies these expenditures are primarily related to driving increased profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies and include items such as facility consolidations and systems to support operating process improvements. capital to acquire/construct real estate these expenditures are directly related to the acquisition of real estate, either through the purchase of a new facility or the exercise of a purchase option in an existing lease, or the construction of a new facility. 10 table of contents following is a table presenting our capital expenditures (1) for 2008, 2009 and 2010 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (dollars in millions) 2008(3) 2009(3) 2010(3) business line growth $ 226 $ 164 $ 125 business operations(2) $ 55 $ 63 $ 72 product development $ 16 $ 17 $ 15 product improvement $ 21 $

for investors as it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the growth and operational efficiency of our business. for the years 2008 through 2010, our total capital expenditures incurred as a percent of revenues were approximately 12%, 11% and 9%, respectively. the decrease in capital expenditures as percent of revenues since 2008 is due primarily to our disciplined approach to capital management, a mix shift toward less capital intense service revenues and moderating growth rates in our physical storage business. following is a table presenting our capital expenditures (1) as a percent of total revenues for 2008, 2009 and 2010 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend 2008(3) 2009(3) 2010(3) business

("mimosa"), a leader in enterprise-class digital content archiving solutions. our nearpoint&reg; solution, which was part of the mimosa acquisition, is an enterprise archiving platform that manages the retention and disposition of email, files and sharepoint&reg; information in accordance with corporate governance policy. as part of our comprehensive portfolio of cloud and on-premise information management solutions, nearpoint content archiving lets companies reduce risk and lower their storage and discovery costs. in october 2010, our nearpoint solution was positioned in the leaders quadrant in gartner inc.'s magic quadrant for enterprise information archiving 2010 report. gartner's magic quadrant report positions technology vendors within a particular quadrant based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute when addressing companies' information archiving needs. growth from existing customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because, on average, they generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our customer base and selling additional records management, data protection &amp; recovery and information destruction services, in new and existing markets, within our existing customer relationships. we also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. services include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, included in complementary services revenue is recycled paper revenues. addition of new customers our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue from existing customers in new and existing markets; 12 table of contents and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. growth through acquisitions the goals of our current acquisition program are (1) to supplement internal growth in our physical businesses by expanding our new service capabilities and industry-specific services and continuing to expand our presence in targeted international markets and (2) to accelerate our leadership and time to market for our targeted technology services. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating information management services companies. acquisitions in the north american physical segment we substantially completed our geographic expansion in north america in 2003. given the small number of attractive acquisition targets in our core physical businesses in north america and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall north american revenue growth than in the past. acquisitions in the north american physical segment will likely focus primarily on expanding our hybrid services capabilities. acquisitions in the international physical segment we substantially completed our geographic expansion in europe and latin america by 2003 and began our expansion into asia pacific in 2005. we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information management services businesses outside north america. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information management services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on developing priority expansion markets in continental europe and asia, with continued leverage of our successful joint venture model. similar to our strategy in north america, we will also explore international acquisitions that strengthen our capabilities in areas such as hybrid services and industry-specific services. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international expansion and acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into more than 35 countries in europe, latin america and asia pacific. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe our joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partner benefits from our expertise in the information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate north american acquisition candidates, when looking at an international investment or acquisition, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we made a joint venture investment. since 2007, we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our brazilian (2008), greek (2010), chinese (2010), hong kong (2010) and singapore (2010) operations. in 2010, to better align our operations with our long-term international growth objectives, we divested our ownership stakes in indonesia and sri lanka. we now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. 13 table of contents our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we derived approximately 32%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we have long-lived assets of approximately 31%, 34% and 35%, respectively, outside of the u.s. acquisitions in the worldwide digital segment our focus on technology innovation allows us to bring leading products and services to market designed to solve customer problems in the areas of data protection, archiving and discovery. our approach to innovation includes our internal development efforts, partnering with other technology companies and acquisition of new and existing technologies. we intend to build or develop our own technology in areas core to our strategy in order to protect and extend our position in the market. examples include, backup and archiving software as a service and data reduction technologies. we are developing global technology partnerships that complement our product and service offerings, allow us to offer a complete solution to the marketplace and keep us in contact with emerging technology companies. our technology acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our product strategy, leadership and time to market and past examples include the connected (2004), livevault (2005), stratify (2007) and mimosa (2010) acquisitions. we expect our future technology acquisitions will be of two primary types, those that bring us new or improved technologies to enhance our existing technology portfolio and those that increase our market position through technology and established revenue streams. competition we compete with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future information management services. we also compete with multiple information management service providers in all geographic areas where we operate. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. this storage requires significant physical space. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. we continue to invest in additional services such as online backup and digital records management, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management. 14 table of contents employees as of december 31, 2010, we employed over 9,800 employees in the u.s. and over 9,600 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2010, an aggregate of 478 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and three provinces in canada. all non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. among other types of insurance that we carry, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles are: medical, workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors and officers liability policies. in 2002, we established a wholly-owned vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary through which we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as 15 table of contents damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "investors" section on our internet website, we make available through a hyperlink to a third party website, free of charge, our annual report on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on form 10-k. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees are available on the investors section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. operational risks governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. in addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances. one state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in some instances european data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. for example, the united states congress is expected to consider legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. the continued emphasis 16 table of contents on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information, resulting in monetary damages which we have paid. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our digital, hybrid services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. we face competition for customers. we compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as our company, for their future information management services needs. we also compete, in both our physical and digital businesses, with multiple information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. 17 table of contents our customers may be constrained in their ability to pay for services or require fewer services. continued economic weakness in the markets where we operate may cause some customers to postpone projects for which they would otherwise retain our services and may, in some instances, cause customers to forgo our services. many of our largest customers are financial institutions that have been particularly affected by the economic downturn; their condition may lead them to reduce their use of our services. in addition, a higher percentage of our customers may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, potentially affecting not only future business but also our ability to collect accounts receivable. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our businesses. because our physical businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because of customers' acceptance of other storage technologies; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2010, we provided services in more than 35 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information management services businesses in foreign markets. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and u.s. regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; 18 table of contents the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. we may not be able to effectively operate and expand our digital businesses. we operate certain digital information management businesses. our participation in these markets poses certain unique risks. for example, we may be unable to: keep up with rapid technological changes, evolving industry expectations and changing customer requirements; compete effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise, capital or other necessary resources; successfully acquire and integrate businesses or technologies to complement our current service offerings; develop, hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise; accurately predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or raise the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these markets. in addition, the digital solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise and the hardware and software products we need to complement our services, may not perform as expected. we may be subject to claims that our technology, particularly with respect to digital services, violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use, especially in our digital business. third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. we operate 990 records management and offsite data protection facilities worldwide, including 587 in the united states alone. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to iron mountain's real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions completed between 1995 and 2005. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. where we believe the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the 19 table of contents position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures which may involve considerable expense to the company. if additional fire safety and suppression measures were required at a large number of our facilities, this could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates through a customer surcharge. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations while increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. these events could result in customer disruption, physical damages to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we regularly face attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. risks relating to our common stock no guaranty of dividend payments or stock repurchases although our board of directors approved a share repurchase program and adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determinations by us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, the price of our common stock in the case of the repurchase program and our board of directors' continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. the terms of our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations. 20 table of contents risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the following table shows important credit statistics as of december 31, 2010 (dollars in millions): total long-term debt $ 3,009.5 total equity $ 1,963.3 debt to equity ratio 1.53 x our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. in addition, certain important 21 table of contents corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. since iron mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. acquisition and expansion risks failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations. the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. nor can we assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of iron mountain or our acquisitions. the failure to successfully integrate these cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have begun our expansion into the asia pacific region. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other information management services businesses in the future. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; 22 table of contents incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 63 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits). as of december 31, 2010, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with seven global banks and four "triple a" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. as of december 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance was $293.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $241.2 million. a substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in u.s. treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2010, we had $399.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2%, and $2,610.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2010, approximately 87% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. after taking into account the january 2011 redemption of the remaining 7 3 / 4 % notes, which was funded with approximately $180.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash on-hand, approximately 80% of our total debt outstanding was fixed on a pro forma basis. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2010 would have been reduced by $2.4 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2010. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd., iron mountain new zealand ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we 63 table of contents are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition, iron mountain switzerland gmbh and our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the u.k., continental europe and canada. specifically, through our 150.0 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and its 175.0 million cad denominated 7 1 / 2 % senior subordinated notes due 2017. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. in the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $7.4 million ($4.6 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended december 31, 2010. as of december 31, 2010, net gains of $8.0 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. we have entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge our exposures to british pounds sterling. as of december 31, 2010, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $196.2 million u.s. dollars and sell 125.0 million in british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with ime. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into a forward contract to hedge our exposures in australian dollars. as of december 31, 2010, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 54.7 million euros and sell 75.0 million australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our australian subsidiary. at the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. during the year ended december 31, 2010, there was $2.0 million in net cash receipts included in cash from operating activities related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net losses in connection with these forward contracts of $2.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.5 million related to the british pound sterling forward contract and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million related to the australian dollar forward contract in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2010, respectively. as 64 table of contents of december 31, 2010, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $80.4 million.risk factors 15

table of contents part i item 1. business. a. development of business. we provide information management services that help organizations around the world lower the costs, risks and inefficiencies of managing their physical and digital data. our solutions enable customers to protect and better use their information regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. we offer comprehensive records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information management challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000 clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific. we have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 94% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2011, we provided services in more than 35 countries on five continents, employed over 17,000 people and operated more than 975 facilities. now in our 61 st year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information management services to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2011. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index and as of december 31, 2011 we were number 643 on the fortune 1000. our success since becoming a public company in 1996 has been driven in large part by our execution of a consistent long-term growth plan to build market leadership by extending our strategic position through service line and global expansion. this growth plan has been sequenced into three phases. the first phase involved establishing leadership and broad market access in our core businesses, records management and data protection &amp; recovery, primarily through acquisitions. in the second phase, we invested in building a successful selling organization to access new customers, converting previously unvended demand. while different parts of our business are in different stages of evolution along our three-phase strategy, as an enterprise, we have transitioned to the third phase of our growth plan, which we call the capitalization phase. in this phase, which we expect to continue for many years, we seek to expand our relationships with our customers to continue solving their increasingly complex information management problems. growing our customer relationships well means expanding our service offerings on a global basis while maximizing our solid core businesses. in doing this, we continue to build what we believe to be a very durable business through disciplined execution. consistent with this model, we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of information management services companies to a growth strategy driven primarily by internal growth. in 2001, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began the first phase of our growth plan in 1996. this has been the case in each year since 2001, with the exception of 2004. in the absence of significant acquisition spending, we expect to achieve a majority of our revenue growth internally in 2012 and beyond. we expect to achieve our long-term growth goals by offering our customers integrated services that address their increasingly complex information management needs regardless of the format, location or lifecycle stage of their information. by offering integrated services, we aim to help our customers reduce the costs, risks and complexities associated with managing their data while increasing their compliance with various laws, regulations, company policies and industry best practices. consistent with 1 table of contents our overall strategy, we are focused on improving our internal revenue growth trajectory in the near-term primarily through a set of specific initiatives. these initiatives are based on a targeted approach to improving our sales effectiveness through increased focus on our core businesses, customer segmentation and enhanced marketing programs. by successfully executing on these initiatives, we expect to increase revenues from our existing customers by selling them new services and by gaining new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their information management service needs or who outsource their information management needs to other vendors. we are also targeting higher growth in certain international businesses as we expand our platform for selling core services and new services in higher growth markets. finally, we are continuing to expand our services portfolio in the hybrid records market, which includes both physical and digital records, to capture what we see as larger, faster growing opportunities. at this stage in our evolution we are also focused on driving increased profitability and cash flow through a disciplined management approach and a focus on optimizing our business operations. comprised of productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements and cost controls, our optimization strategy has produced significant and visible results. between 2007 and 2011, we have compounded annual growth rates of 8% for adjusted operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net ("adjusted oibda"), 15% for adjusted earnings per share and 28% for free cash flows before acquisitions and discretionary investments ("fcf"). during that same period, we reduced our capital expenditures (excluding real estate) as a percent of revenues from 13.5% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2011. these gains were driven primarily by the optimization of our north american business segment as we increased adjusted oibda margins in that segment by more than 700 basis points. our focus is on sustaining the high margin, high profitability levels of the north american business segment while optimizing our international business segment using the same strategies. we expect to increase our adjusted oibda margins in the international business segment by approximately 700 basis points between 2010 and the end of 2013. for more detailed definitions and reconciliations of adjusted oibda, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations and fcf and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures." we are committed to delivering stockholder value. to that end, and supported by our increased profitability and strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in february 2010 consisting of a share repurchase authorization of up to $150.0 million and a dividend policy under which we have paid and in the future intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. our first ever quarterly cash dividend, declared in march 2010, was $0.0625 per share. since initiating our stockholder payout program in february 2010, our board of directors has approved increases in the amount authorized under our share repurchase program of up to an additional $1.05 billion, bringing the total authorization to $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2011, we have purchased 36.6 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion under this program. we have also increased our quarterly dividend on two occasions, most recently to $0.25 per share in june 2011, which represents a 300% increase over the quarterly amount declared in march 2010. in april 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan to increase stockholder value. the key components of our plan are: (i) sustaining a leadership position in our north american business segment; (ii) driving substantial improvements in our international business segment; and (iii) committing to significant stockholder payouts of $2.2 billion through 2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out through may 2012. as of december 31, 2011, we had returned $1.1 billion to stockholders against our commitment of returning $1.2 billion through may 2012, including $0.1 billion in dividends and $1.0 billion in share repurchases. as part of our strategic plan, in june 2011, we completed the sale of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and ediscovery solutions businesses (the "digital business") for approximately $395.4 million in cash. additionally, in connection with our strategic 2 table of contents portfolio review of certain international operations, we sold our new zealand operations in october 2011 for approximately $10.0 million in cash and, in december 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our records management business in italy (the "italian business"). b. description of business. overview our information management services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services, and information destruction services. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include e-mail and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes, hard drives and optical disks. our records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements, implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. included within records management services are our hybrid services. these services help organizations gain better access to, and ultimately control over, their paper records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information lifecycle solutions. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services. our data protection &amp; recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. our technology-based data protection &amp; recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. since our sale of the digital business, we continue to offer these technology-based services primarily through partnerships. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. our information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. secure shredding services complete the lifecycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. these services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records, which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide, or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with, and serviced by, an information management services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. in addition to our core records management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services. 3 table of contents electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. we believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. acquisitions in a highly fragmented industry the physical information management services industry has long been and remains a highly fragmented industry with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry driven primarily by us and certain of our larger competitors. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. we believe that since the 1990s there has been ongoing acquisition activity in the physical information management services industry, both in north america and internationally, because of the opportunities for larger information management services providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for more sophisticated, technology-based solutions. we believe that this trend is also due to, and may continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one physical information management services vendor in multiple cities and countries for its physical information management service needs. larger national or multinational information management service companies are better able to satisfy the demands of larger multi-city or multi-national customers than single city competitors. 4 table of contents attractive acquisitions, many of which are small, in north america and internationally continue to exist and we may from time to time acquire these businesses where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders. characteristics of our business we generate our revenues by providing storage, core records management, data protection &amp; recovery, information destruction, hybrid services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. providing outsourced information management services is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for our revenue growth. core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. in our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations. additionally, core services include certain hybrid services and recurring project revenues. as is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature. in 2011, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 88% of our total consolidated revenues. in addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services, including special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). in addition, complementary services revenue includes recycled paper revenue. complementary services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. these services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components. in general, our north american business and our international business segments offer the products and services discussed below, in their respective geographies. the amount of revenues derived from our north american business and international business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. service offerings our information management services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records management and data protection &amp; recovery categories. currently, we only offer physical services in the information destruction services category. records management services by far our largest category of services, records management services consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. core to any records management program is the handling and transportation of stored records and the eventual destruction of those records upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. this is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. other records management services include our hybrid services as well as compliant records management and consulting services, health information management solutions, im entertainment services, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. hard copy business records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer for long periods of time with limited activity. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis and these files are typically more active. storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit 5 table of contents basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security. service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media and include adding records to storage, temporarily removing records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanently withdrawing records from storage and destroying records. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2011, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles. the growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records management challenges. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. the focus of our hybrid business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our hybrid services complement our core service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that integrate and extend our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our hybrid services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new edm solutions. we offer records management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions. medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. we provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. we also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons. 6 table of contents other complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores marketing literature and other materials for its customers and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations based on current and prospective customer requests. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. a growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by imfs. digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with variable messages, graphics and content. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. we divested ourselves of our domain name management product line in 2010 and our digital business, including our former wholly owned subsidiaries, mimosa systems, inc. and stratify, inc., and new zealand operations in 2011. also, we committed to selling our italian business in december 2011. consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we eliminated all revenues associated with these businesses, which have all been reflected as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, from the calculation of our internal growth rates for 2009, 2010 and 2011. data protection &amp; recovery services our data protection &amp; recovery services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with regard to the off-site vaulting of data for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. we provide data protection &amp; recovery services for both physical and electronic records. we also offer technology escrow services in this category. physical data protection &amp; recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. since our sale of the digital business, we continue to offer this service pursuant to a reseller agreement with autonomy corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of england and wales ("autonomy"). through our technology escrow services business, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets such as software source code, object code and data in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. the result is increased control and leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage. information destruction services our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations. secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services, completing the lifecycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of archival records. these services typically include the 7 table of contents scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the u.s., canada, the united kingdom, australia and latin america. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting adjusted oibda allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 23 consecutive years. for each of the three years 2009 through 2011, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 55% or more of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and adjusted oibda. historically non-cyclical storage business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage business as a result of economic downturns although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. we believe that companies that have outsourced records management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with accelerating destruction of their records, switching vendors or moving their records management services programs in-house. however, during the current economic downturn, which is more severe and has lasted longer than other recent downturns, destruction rates have increased as some customers have been more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower storage costs in the long-term. in addition, we have experienced longer sales cycles and lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment rates and generally lower levels of business activity. combined, these impacts have resulted in lower net volume growth rates. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. for each of the three years 2009 through 2011, total net volume storage growth has been approximately 2% on a global basis. inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have, on average, sent us additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. however, during the current economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, as described above, has resulted in net volume growth from existing customers being negative at times in certain markets. we expect that after the economy has improved, our growth from existing customers will improve although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. we believe the continued growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of information management services; and 8 table of contents (4) our positive pricing actions; however, in the current economic downturn, elevated destruction and withdrawal rates have resulted in lower net volume growth in recent quarters. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2011, we had over 155,000 clients in a variety of industries. we currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 94% of the fortune 1000. no customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011. for each of the three years 2009 through 2011, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 3%. capital expenditures related primarily to business line growth and ongoing operations. our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. as the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. every year we expend capital to support a number of different objectives. the majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. these expenditures are generally smaller and more discretionary in nature. below are descriptions of the major types of capital expenditures we are likely to make in a given year: capital to support business line growth these expenditures are primarily related to capacity expansion such as investments in new building outfitting, carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins and technology service storage and processing capacity. capital to support ongoing business operations these expenditures are primarily related to major repairs and/or the replacement of assets, such as facilities, warehouse equipment and computers, previously referred to as maintenance capital expenditures. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. capital for new product development these expenditures are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition. capital for product improvement these expenditures are primarily related to product and service enhancements that support our leadership position in the various markets in which we operate. spending in this area includes items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements. capital to support operational efficiencies these expenditures are primarily related to driving increased profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies and include items such as facility consolidations and systems to support operating process improvements. capital to acquire/construct real estate these expenditures are directly related to the acquisition of real estate, either through the purchase of a new facility or the exercise of a purchase option in an existing lease, or the construction of a new facility. 9 table of contents following is a table presenting our capital expenditures for 2009, 2010 and 2011 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (dollars in millions) 2009(1)(2) 2010(1)(2) 2011(1)(2) business line growth $ 156 $ 116 $ 81 business operations(3) 56 65 84 product development 12 10 2 product improvement 28

as it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the growth and operational efficiency of our business. for the years 2009 through 2011, our total capital expenditures incurred as a percent of revenues were approximately 11%, 8% and 7%, respectively. the decrease in capital expenditures as percent of revenues since 2009 is due primarily to our disciplined approach to capital management, a shift toward less capital intense service revenues and moderating growth rates in our physical storage business. following is a table presenting our capital expenditures as a percent of total revenues for 2009, 2010 and 2011 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend 2009(1)(2) 2010(1)(2) 2011(1)(2) business line growth

support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. growth strategy we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with comprehensive records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information management challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. we expect to maintain a leadership position in the information management services industry around the world by enabling customers to protect and better use their information regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. 10 table of contents in the u.s. and canada, we seek to be one of the largest information management services providers in each of our markets. internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information management services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. our near-term growth objectives are comprised of a set of specific initiatives including: (1) increasing our focus on our core businesses with a targeted, low risk approach to improving our sales effectiveness and thereby increasing revenues with our existing customers by selling them new services and gaining net new customers; (2) higher growth in our international businesses as we expand our platform for selling core services and new services in higher growth markets; and (3) continuing to expand our services portfolio in the hybrid market to capture those larger, faster growing opportunities. although the focus will be on growing our business organically, targeted acquisitions will continue to play a role in our overall growth strategy. introduction of new products and services we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. adding new products and services allows us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth from existing customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage and storage-related services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. however, during the current economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, as described above, has resulted in net volume growth from existing customers being negative at times in certain markets. we expect that after the economy has improved, our growth from existing customers will improve although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our customer base and selling additional records management, data protection &amp; recovery and information destruction services in new and existing markets within our existing customer relationships. we also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products such as special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). addition of new customers our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue from existing customers in new and existing markets; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. growth through acquisitions the goal of our current acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to expand our presence in targeted international markets, continuing to make fold-in acquisitions in north america and expanding our new service capabilities and industry-specific services. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating information management services companies. 11 table of contents acquisitions in the north american business segment although we substantially completed our geographic expansion in north america in 2003, we have since acquired and we continue to seek to acquire information management services businesses in the u.s. and canada. given the relatively smaller size of the acquisition targets in our core physical businesses in north america and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall north american business segment revenue growth than in the past. acquisitions in the international business segment we substantially completed our geographic expansion in europe and latin america by 2003 and entered the asia pacific market in 2005. we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information management services businesses in targeted markets outside north america. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in continental europe, latin america and asia, with continued leverage of our successful joint venture model. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international expansion and acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into more than 35 countries in europe, latin america and asia pacific. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe our joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partners benefit from our expertise in the information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate north american acquisition candidates, when looking at an international investment or acquisition, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we made a joint venture investment. since 2008, we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our greek (2010), chinese (2010), hong kong (2010) and singapore (2010) operations. in 2010, to better align our operations with our long-term international growth objectives, we sold our ownership stakes in indonesia and sri lanka. we now own more than 97% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. in connection with the strategic review of certain of our international businesses, we sold our new zealand operations in october 2011. additionally, in december 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our italian business. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we derived approximately 31%, 32% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we had long-lived assets of approximately 34%, 36% and 36%, respectively, outside of the u.s. 12 table of contents competition we are the global leader in the physical information management services industry with operations in more than 35 countries. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future information management services. we also compete with numerous information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. the physical information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that the majority of physical information management services companies serve a single city and are either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. this storage requires significant physical space. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records as paper documents. we continue to provide additional services such as online backup, primarily through partnerships, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management. employees as of december 31, 2011, we employed over 8,800 employees in the u.s. and over 8,200 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2011, an aggregate of 469 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and three provinces in canada. all non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include: medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. in 2002, we established a wholly owned vermont domiciled 13 table of contents captive insurance company as a subsidiary through which we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. our liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "for investors" section on our internet website, we make available through a hyperlink to a third party website, free of charge, our annual report on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on form 10-k. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees are available on the "for investors" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." 14 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. operational risks governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. in addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances. one state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in some instances european data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. for example, the u.s. congress is considering legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. in addition, the european commission has proposed a new regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. it is anticipated that the new proposal will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as iron mountain, that process data of citizens of members of the european union. the continued emphasis on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary damages which we have paid. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. 15 table of contents our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. u.s. federal government initiatives have resulted in many health care providers adopting programs to evolve to greater use of electronic medical records. in addition, as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records we store become less active and more archived. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. the adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents we store. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our hybrid services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. we face competition for customers. we compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as iron mountain, for their future information management services needs. we also compete with multiple information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. our customers may be constrained in their ability to pay for services or require fewer services. continued economic weakness in the markets where we operate may cause some customers to postpone projects for which they would otherwise retain our services and may, in some instances, cause customers to reduce or forgo our services. many of our largest customers are financial institutions that have been particularly affected by the economic downturn; their condition may lead them to reduce their use of our services. in addition, customers may increasingly seek protection under bankruptcy laws, potentially affecting not only future business but also our ability to collect accounts receivable. 16 table of contents failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our u.s. government general services administration multiple award schedule contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. selling our services to the u.s. government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future u.s. government contracting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial position. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2011, we provided services in more than 35 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information management services businesses in select foreign markets. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and u.s. regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; 17 table of contents unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2011, we operated 932 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 615 in the united states alone. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to iron mountain's real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. where we believe the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures which may involve considerable expense to iron mountain. if additional fire safety and suppression measures were required at a large number of our facilities, this could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates through a customer surcharge. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations while increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damages to one or more key operating facilities, the 18 table of contents temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. risks relating to our strategic review no guaranty that any of the alternative financing, capital, and tax strategies being evaluated, including a potential conversion to a reit, will be implemented or will be successful if implemented. in april 2011 we entered into a settlement agreement with elliott associates, l.p. and elliott international, l.p. in which we agreed to form a special committee of our board of directors to, among other things, evaluate ways to maximize stockholder value through alternative financing, capital, and tax strategies (the "strategic review"), including evaluating a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust (a "reit"). the strategic review has required, and may continue to require, the expenditure of significant time and resources by us. the strategic review process is complex and may divert management's time and attention. we may not pursue any of the alternative strategies being evaluated, including a potential conversion to a reit, and we can provide no assurances that any strategy we pursue will be successfully implemented or achieve the intended benefits. finally, stockholder litigation that may arise in connection with the strategic review may result in significant costs for defense or liability. these consequences, alone or in combination, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. risks relating to our common stock no guaranty of dividend payments or stock repurchases. our board of directors approved a share repurchase program and adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. in addition, on april 19, 2011, we announced our intention to make stockholder payouts of approximately $2.2 billion through 2013, with approximately $1.2 billion of capital returned to stockholders by may 2012 through a combination of share repurchases, ongoing quarterly dividends and potential one-time dividends. although we are committed to returning capital to stockholders and returned $1.15 billion between april 19, 2011 and february 10, 2012, any determinations by us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the form and mix of such stockholder payouts, will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and strategy, the price of our common stock (in the case of the repurchase program) and our board of directors' continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. the terms of our credit agreement 19 table of contents and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations. risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the following table shows important credit statistics as of december 31, 2011 (dollars in millions): total long-term debt $ 3,353.6 total equity $ 1,254.3 debt to equity ratio 2.67 x our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness, the payment of quarterly dividends or the repurchase of shares of our common stock; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. 20 table of contents we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. in addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. since iron mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. acquisition and expansion risks failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations. the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other information management services businesses in the future. 21 table of contents this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 65 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily u.s. treasuries) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and one "triple a" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. as of december 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181.8 million. a substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in u.s. treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2011, we had $586.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.6%, and $2,766.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2011, approximately 82.5% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2011 would have been reduced by approximately $3.4 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2011. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar 65 table of contents and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition, iron mountain switzerland gmbh, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, continental europe and canada. specifically, through our 150.0 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255.0 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and its 175.0 million cad denominated 7 1 / 2 % senior subordinated notes due 2017. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. in the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $8.6 million ($5.4 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended december 31, 2011. as of december 31, 2011, net gains of $13.4 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. we have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $195.6 million u.s. dollars and sell 125.0 million british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with ime. as of december 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $75.1 million u.s. dollars and sell 73.0 million australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our australian subsidiary. at the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. during the year ended december 31, 2011, there was $1.1 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net gains in connection with these forward contracts of $1.2 million (including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.0 million related to certain british pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.8 million related to the australian dollar forward contract offset by an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million related to a british pound sterling forward contract) in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of 66 table of contents operations as of december 31, 2011, respectively. as of december 31, 2011, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2011 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $79.8 million.risk factors 16 risk factors" of this annual report. you

we store records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage. we offer comprehensive records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000 clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and asia pacific. we have a diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 94% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2012, we operated over 1,000 facilities, comprising 64.5 million square feet, in 35 countries on five continents and employed over 17,500 people. now in our 62 nd year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a u.s. business operating fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of $104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related information management services to customers in markets around the world with over 1,000 facilities (64.5 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index, and as of december 31, 2012 we were number 644 on the fortune 1000. our success since becoming a public company in 1996 has been driven in large part by our execution of a consistent long-term growth plan to build industry leadership by extending our presence through service line and global expansion. this growth plan has been sequenced into three phases. the first phase involved establishing leadership and broad market access in our core storage solutions and related records management services and data protection &amp; recovery services, primarily through acquisitions. in the second phase, we invested in building a successful selling organization to access new customers, converting previously unvended demand. while different parts of our business are in different stages of evolution along our three-phase strategy, in north america and our more developed international markets, we have transitioned to the third phase of our growth plan, which we call the capitalization phase. in this phase, which we expect to continue for many years, we seek to expand our relationships with our customers to continue solving their increasingly complex storage and information management problems. growing our customer relationships means expanding our global storage and service offerings while maximizing our solid core businesses. in doing this, we continue to build what we believe to be a very durable business through disciplined execution. consistent with this model, we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a growth strategy that includes multiple sources of revenue growth. these sources of revenue growth include: (i) organic growth comprised of growth from existing customers, sales to new customers and acquiring customer relationships from third-parties; (ii) acquisitions of storage and information management services businesses; and (iii) the introduction of new rental streams and ancillary services. we expect to achieve our long-term growth goals by focusing on expanding our global core storage rental business through increased incoming volumes and by offering our customers integrated services 1 table of contents that address their increasingly complex storage and information management needs regardless of the format, location or lifecycle stage of their information. storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. there are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. we also expect to invest in the acquisitions of customer relationships and acquisitions of storage and information management services businesses. in north america and our more developed international markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. we also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. finally, we are continuing to add new rental streams and ancillary services to our portfolio to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. at this stage in our evolution we also are focused on driving increased profitability and cash flow through a disciplined management approach and a focus on optimizing our business operations. consisting of productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements and cost controls, our optimization strategy has produced significant and visible results. between 2006 and 2010, we had compounded annual growth rates of 11% for adjusted oibda, defined as operating income before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) intangible impairments, (3) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net and (4) costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest, the work of the strategic review special committee of our board of directors (the "special committee") and the proposed reit conversion, discussed below (collectively "reit costs"), 17% for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations and 3% for earnings per share from continuing operations. during that same period, we reduced our capital expenditures (excluding real estate) as a percent of revenues from 13.4% in 2006 to 7.9% in 2010. these gains were driven primarily by cost reductions and the optimization of our north american business segment as we increased adjusted oibda margins in that segment by nearly 800 basis points between 2006 and 2010. our current focus is on sustaining the high margin, high profitability levels of the north american business segment while optimizing our international business segment using the same strategies. we expect to achieve 25% adjusted oibda margins in the international business segment by the end of 2013, a 700 basis points improvement over 2010 levels. beyond 2013, we expect to grow consolidated adjusted oibda margins at a much slower rate because we will have already completed the major profit improvement initiatives in both the north american and international business segments. in our more developed markets, continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest margin improvement, a portion of which we expect to reinvest in our business. in our emerging markets, margins should expand as the local businesses mature, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. for more detailed definitions and reconciliations of adjusted oibda and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures" of this annual report. we are committed to delivering stockholder value. to that end, and supported by our increased profitability and strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in february 2010 consisting of a share repurchase authorization of up to $150.0 million and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. our first ever quarterly cash dividend, declared in march 2010, was $0.0625 per share. subsequently, our board of directors approved an increase in the amount authorized under our share repurchase program of up to an additional $1.05 billion, bringing the total authorization to $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2012, 2 table of contents we have purchased 37.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.1 billion under this program. we have also increased our quarterly dividend on three occasions, including most recently in june 2012, when we announced an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend payments through 2013. the june 2012 increase to our quarterly dividend, to $0.27 per share, represented a 332% increase over the quarterly dividend amount declared in march 2010. in april 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan to increase stockholder value. the key components of our plan are: (i) sustaining a leadership position in our north american business segment; (ii) driving substantial improvements in our international business segment; and (iii) committing to significant stockholder payouts of $2.2 billion through 2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out by may 2012. we fulfilled the commitment to return $1.2 billion of capital to stockholders by may 2012. the remaining $1.0 billion of the stockholder payout plan has been replaced by our regular quarterly dividends and the stockholder distributions and expenditures associated with our plan to convert to a reit (the "conversion plan"). as part of our strategic plan, in june 2011, we completed the sale of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and ediscovery solutions businesses (the "digital business") for approximately $395.4 million in cash. additionally, in connection with our strategic portfolio review of certain international operations, we sold our new zealand operations in october 2011, and we sold our italian operations in april 2012. potential reit conversion in june 2012, we announced our intention to pursue conversion to a reit. the plan to convert to a reit was unanimously approved by our board of directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies. assuming we are successful in converting, we would plan to elect reit status no sooner than our taxable year beginning january 1, 2014. any reit election made by us must be effective as of the beginning of a taxable year; therefore, if, as a calendar year taxpayer, we are unable to convert to a reit by january 1, 2014, the next possible conversion date would be january 1, 2015. our conversion plan currently includes submitting requests for private letter rulings ("plr") to the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs"). our plr requests have multiple components, and the conversion to a reit will require favorable rulings from the irs on numerous technical tax issues, including the characterization of our racking assets as real estate. we submitted our plr requests to the irs during the third quarter of 2012, but the irs may not provide a favorable response to our plr requests until the second half of 2013 or at all. our ability to qualify as a reit will depend upon our continuing compliance following our conversion to a reit with various requirements, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit, we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. even if we qualify for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the u.s. federal income tax regime for reits described above, many states do not completely follow u.s. federal rules and some may not follow them at all. we believe that electing reit status will maximize our enterprise value as we advance our strategy and provide significant benefits to our stockholders. a key component of our overall strategic plan is our capital allocation strategy to return excess cash to our stockholders, and we believe operating as a reit aligns well with this strategy. in november 2012, we paid a $700.0 million special dividend (the "special dividend") representing the initial distribution to satisfy the requirement that we pay to stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits which is estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion (the "e&amp;p distribution") in connection with our potential conversion to a reit. the special dividend consisted of $140.0 million paid in cash and $560.0 million in common stock value. 3 table of contents we issued 17.0 million new shares in connection with the special dividend. we also believe that through conversion to a reit we may be able to expand our shareholder base and lower our cost of financing through increased ownership of currently leased real estate. we expect our long-term capital allocation strategy as a reit will naturally shift toward increased use of equity to support lower leverage, though our leverage may increase in the short-term to fund the costs to support the conversion plan. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview" and " liquidity and capital resources" of this annual report for more information regarding our possible conversion to a reit, including anticipated costs associated with the conversion plan, and item 1a. "risk factors risks related to the proposed reit conversion" of this annual report for a discussion of risks associated with our conversion to a reit, including impediments to a conversion. b. description of business. overview we provide cost-effective secure storage for all major media, including paper (which is the primary form of records storage we provide), as well as secure off-site storage of data backup media. our related information management services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services, and information destruction services. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include e-mail and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes, hard drives and optical disks. our records management services include: flexible retrieval access, retention management and records management program development and implementation based on best practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements and policy-based programs. also included within records management services are our document management solutions ("dms"). dms helps organizations gain better access to, and ultimately control over, their paper records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information lifecycle solutions. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services. our data protection &amp; recovery services include the secure handling and transportation of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus as well as disaster preparedness, planning and support. our technology-based data protection &amp; recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. since our sale of the digital business, we offer these technology-based services primarily through partnerships. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. our information destruction services almost exclusively consist of secure shredding services. secure shredding services complete the lifecycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. these services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records, which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers that we provide, or the shredding of documents stored in our records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. 4 table of contents physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with, and serviced by, a storage and information management services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. in addition to our core records management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services relating to storage and information management. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. we believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. 5 table of contents acquisitions in a highly fragmented industry the storage and information management services industry has long been and remains a highly fragmented industry with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. we believe this acquisition activity, which is ongoing, is due to the opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. attractive acquisition opportunities, many of which are small, in north america and internationally continue to exist, and we may pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders. characteristics of our business we generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base in 64.5 million square feet of real estate around the globe and providing to our customers core records management, data protection &amp; recovery, information destruction, dms services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services. providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue growth. core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. in our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations. additionally, core services include certain dms services and recurring project revenues. as is the case with storage rental revenue, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature. in 2012, our storage rental and core service revenues represented approximately 89% of our total consolidated revenues. in addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services, including special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). furthermore, complementary services revenue includes recycled paper revenue. complementary services address specific needs of our customers and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. these services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components. in general, our north american business and our international business segments offer storage and the information management services discussed below, in their respective geographies. the amount of revenues derived from our north american business and international business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. secure storage we provide cost-effective secure storage for all major media, including paper (which is the primary form of records storage we provide) as well as secure off-site vaulting of data backup media. renting secure space to customers for the purpose of storing paper records and data backup media is by far our largest source of revenue. records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. the secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs and storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis. hard copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time with limited activity in cartons packed by the customer. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per 6 table of contents storage unit basis, usually per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security. vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. vital records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. service offerings our information management services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records management and data protection &amp; recovery categories. currently, we offer only physical services in the information destruction services category. records management services central to any records management program is the handling and transportation of stored records and the eventual destruction of those records upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. this is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. other records management services include our dms services as well as compliant records management and consulting services, health information storage and management solutions, entertainment services, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media and include adding records to storage, temporarily removing records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanently withdrawing records from storage and destroying records. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2012, our fleet consisted of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles. the growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. the focus of our dms business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our dms services complement our core service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that integrate and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their edm solutions. we offer records management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. for example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically 7 table of contents stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. in addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. we also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons. other complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores marketing literature and other materials for its customers and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations based on current and prospective customer needs. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. a growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by imfs. digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with variable messages, graphics and content. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive storage and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in storage solutions and information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs to store records and manage information. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. we sold our domain name management product line in 2010 and the digital business, including our former wholly owned subsidiaries, mimosa systems, inc. and stratify, inc., and our new zealand operations in 2011. also, we sold our italian operations in april 2012. consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we eliminated all revenues associated with these businesses, which have all been reflected as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, from the calculation of our internal growth rates for 2010, 2011 and 2012. data protection &amp; recovery services our data protection &amp; recovery services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with regard to disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. we provide data protection &amp; recovery services for both physical and electronic records. we also offer technology escrow services in this category. physical data protection &amp; recovery services consist of the rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to 8 table of contents our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. after the sale of the digital business, we continue to offer this service pursuant to a reseller agreement with autonomy corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of england and wales ("autonomy"). through our technology escrow services business, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets such as software source code, object code and data in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. the result is increased control and leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage. information destruction services our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations. secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services, completing the lifecycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of archival records. these services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the u.s., canada, the united kingdom, ireland, australia and latin america. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting adjusted oibda allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage rental fees have grown for 24 consecutive years. for each of the three years 2010 through 2012, storage rental revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 55% or more of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and adjusted oibda. historically non-cyclical storage rental business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. however, during the recent economic downturn, which was more severe and lasted longer than other recent downturns, destruction rates increased as some customers have been more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower storage rental costs in the long-term. in addition, we have experienced longer sales cycles and lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and generally lower levels of business activity. combined, these impacts have resulted in lower net volume growth rates. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage rental revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. for each of the three years 2010 through 2012, total net volume growth has been approximately 2% on a global basis. 9 table of contents inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have, on average, sent us additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. however, during the recent economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, as described above, resulted in lower consolidated net volume growth in recent quarters, including negative net volume growth from existing customers at times in certain markets. since reaching unusually high levels in 2009, our destruction rates have stabilized at rates closer to historical norms. after the economy has improved, we expect our growth from existing customers should improve although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. we believe the continued growth of our physical records storage rental revenues is the result of a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, customer satisfaction with our services and net price increases. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2012, we had over 155,000 clients in a variety of industries in 35 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 94% of the fortune 1000. no single customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. for each of the three years 2010 through 2012, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 3%. capital expenditures related primarily to business line growth and ongoing operations. our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected storage rental revenue and service revenue growth and ongoing operations, new products and services and increased profitability. as the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. every year we expend capital to support a number of different objectives. the majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. additionally, we invest capital to acquire or construct real estate. we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. these expenditures are generally relatively small and discretionary in nature. below are descriptions of the major types of capital expenditures we are likely to make in a given year: capital to support business line growth these expenditures are primarily related to capacity expansion such as investments in new building outfitting, carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins and technology service storage and processing capacity. capital to acquire/construct real estate these expenditures are directly related to the acquisition of real estate, either through the purchase or construction of a new facility or the buyout of an existing lease. capital to support ongoing business operations these expenditures are primarily related to major repairs and/or the replacement of assets, such as facilities, warehouse equipment and computers. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. capital for new product development these expenditures are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition. capital for product improvement these expenditures are primarily related to product and service enhancements that support our leadership position in the industry. spending in this area includes items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements. 10 table of contents capital to support operational efficiencies these expenditures are primarily related to driving increased profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies and include items such as facility consolidations and systems to support operating process improvements. following is a table presenting our capital expenditures for 2010, 2011 and 2012 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (dollars in millions) 2010(1)(2) 2011(1)(2) 2012(1)(2) business line growth $ 116 $ 81 $ 61 real estate 14 20 54

(14 ) (20 ) (66 ) total capital, net of real estate and reit capital expenditures $ 230 $ 198 $ 182 we believe that capital expenditures, net of real estate and capital expenditures that are part of our reit costs, incurred as a percent of revenues is a meaningful metric for investors because it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the growth and operational efficiency of our business. for the years 2010 through 2012, our total capital expenditures, net of real estate and capital expenditures that are part of our reit costs, incurred as a percent of revenues were approximately 8%, 7% and 6%, respectively. this decrease since 2010 is due primarily to our disciplined approach to capital management, a shift toward less capital intensive service revenues and moderating growth rates in our physical storage rental business. following is a table presenting our capital expenditures as a percent of total revenues for 2010, 2011 and 2012 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend 2010(1)(2) 2011(1)(2) 2012(1)(2) business line growth 4.0 % 2.7 % 2.0 % real estate 0.5 % 0.7 % 1.8 % business

support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. 11 table of contents growth strategy we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive information management services, including records management services, data protection &amp; recovery services and information destruction services. we have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. we expect to maintain a leadership position in the storage and information management services industry around the world by enabling customers to store, protect and better use their information regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the storage and information management industry and to make additional fold-in acquisitions in more developed markets and acquisitions and investments to establish an industry-leading presence in selected emerging markets. our near-term growth objectives include a set of specific initiatives: (1) increasing our incoming storage volumes with a targeted, low risk approach to improving our sales effectiveness, thereby increasing revenues from our existing customers and gaining new customers; (2) driving higher volume growth in our international businesses as we expand our platform for selling storage, core services and new services in higher growth markets; and (3) continuing to add new rental streams and ancillary services to our portfolio to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions and pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses. introduction of new products and services we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth from existing customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. however, during the recent economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, resulted in lower consolidated net volume growth in recent quarters, including negative net volume growth from existing customers at times in certain markets. since reaching unusually high levels in 2009, our destruction rates have stabilized at rates closer to historical norms. after the economy has improved, we expect our growth from existing customers should improve although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, information management services and products in new and existing markets within our existing customer relationships. these services and products include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). 12 table of contents expanding new and existing customer relationships our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. growth through acquisitions the goal of our current acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to expand our presence in targeted emerging markets, continuing to make fold-in acquisitions in north america and more developed international markets and expanding our rental streams, new service capabilities and industry-specific services. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating storage and information management services companies. acquisitions in the north american business segment we have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in the u.s. and canada. given the relatively small size of most acquisition targets in our core physical businesses in north america, where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall north american business segment revenue growth than in the past. acquisitions in the international business segment we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted markets outside north america, particularly emerging markets. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in continental europe, latin america and asia pacific, with continued leverage of our successful joint venture model. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international expansion and acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into more than 30 countries in europe, latin america and asia pacific. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate north american acquisition candidates, when looking at an international investment or acquisition, we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. since 2008, we have acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our greece (2010), china (2010), hong kong (2010) and singapore (2010) operations and increased our equity ownership interest in our switzerland (2012) and turkey (2012) operations. in 2010, to better align our operations with our long-term international growth objectives, we sold our equity ownership interest in indonesia and sri lanka. we now own more than 97% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. in connection with the strategic review of certain of our 13 table of contents international businesses, we sold our new zealand operations in october 2011 and our italian operations in april 2012. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we derived approximately 32%, 34% and 35%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had long-lived assets of approximately 36%, 36% and 37%, respectively, outside of the u.s. competition we are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 35 countries. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future storage and information management services. we also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. the physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and records management services. this storage requires significant physical space. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the primary means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records as paper documents. we continue to provide additional services such as online backup, primarily through partnerships, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. employees as of december 31, 2012, we employed over 8,500 employees in the u.s. and over 9,000 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2012, an aggregate of 445 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and three provinces in canada. all non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes 14 table of contents that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include: medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our dms services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

under the heading "corporate governance." item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. risks related to the proposed reit conversion although following our strategic review process we have chosen to pursue conversion to a reit, we may not be successful in converting to a reit effective january 1, 2014, or at all. as previously announced, in june 2011 we formed the special committee to evaluate, among other things, ways to maximize stockholder value through alternative financing, capital, and tax strategies, including evaluating a potential conversion to a reit (the "conversion plan"). in june 2012, our board of directors unanimously approved the conversion plan. there are significant implementation and operational complexities to address in connection with converting to a reit, including obtaining a favorable plr from the irs, completing internal reorganizations, modifying accounting, information technology and real estate systems, receiving stockholder approvals, refinancing our revolving credit and term loan facilities and making required stockholder payouts. further, changes in legislation or the federal tax rules could adversely impact our ability to convert to a reit and/or the attractiveness of converting to a reit. similarly, even if we are able to satisfy the existing reit requirements, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time in ways that could be disadvantageous to us. additionally, several conditions must be met in order to complete the conversion to a reit, and the timing and outcome of many of these conditions are beyond our control. for example, we cannot provide assurance that the irs will ultimately provide us with a favorable plr or that any favorable plr will be received in a timely manner for us to convert successfully to a reit as of january 1, 2014. even if the transactions necessary to implement reit conversion are effected, our board of directors may decide not to elect reit status, or to delay such election, if it determines in its sole discretion that it is not in the best interests of our stockholders. we can provide no assurance if or when conversion to a reit will be successful. furthermore, if we do convert, the effective date of the reit conversion could be delayed beyond january 1, 2014, in which event we could not elect reit status until the taxable year beginning january 1, 2015, at the earliest. 16 table of contents we may not qualify or remain qualified as a reit, and/or may not realize the anticipated benefits to stockholders, including the achievement of tax savings for us, increases in income distributable to stockholders, the potential to lower our cost of financing through increased ownership of currently leased real estate and the expansion of our stockholder base. if we convert to a reit, we plan to operate in a manner consistent with reit qualification rules; however, we cannot provide assurance that we will, in fact, qualify as a reit or remain so qualified. reit qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. even if we are successful converting to a reit and electing reit status, we cannot provide assurance that our stockholders will experience benefits attributable to our qualification and taxation as a reit, including our ability to (1) reduce our corporate level federal tax through distributions to stockholders, (2) lower our cost of financing or (3) expand our stockholder base. the realization of the anticipated benefits to stockholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside our control, including interest rates. in addition, future distributions to stockholders will depend on our cash flows, as well as the impact of alternative, more attractive investments as compared to dividends. further, changes in legislation or the federal tax rules could adversely impact the benefits of being a reit. complying with reit qualification requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and to remain so qualified, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. for example, under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more u.s. taxable reit subsidiaries ("trs") and other nonqualifying assets. this limitation may affect our ability to make large investments in other non-reit qualifying operations or assets. as such, compliance with reit tests may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of significant nonqualifying assets and the material expansion of non-real estate activities. there are uncertainties relating to our estimate of our e&amp;p distribution, as well as the timing of such e&amp;p distribution and the percentage of common stock and cash we may distribute. we have provided an estimated range of the e&amp;p distribution. we are in the process of conducting a study of our pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of our 2011 taxable year using our historic tax returns and other available information. this is a very involved and complex study that is not yet complete, and the actual result of the study relating to our pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of our 2011 taxable year may be materially different from our current estimates. in addition, the estimated range of our e&amp;p distribution is based on our projected taxable income for our 2012 and 2013 taxable years and our current business plans and performance, but our actual earnings and profits (and the actual amount of the e&amp;p distribution) will vary depending on, among other items, the timing of certain transactions, our actual taxable income and performance for 2012 and 2013 and possible changes in legislation or tax rules and irs revenue procedures relating to distributions of earnings and profits. for these reasons and others, our actual e&amp;p distribution may be materially different from our estimated range. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we paid to our stockholders a special dividend of $700 million, which represented the initial portion of the expected e&amp;p distribution. we expect the balance of the 17 table of contents e&amp;p distribution will be paid in 2014, but the timing of the planned payment of the remaining e&amp;p distribution, which may or may not occur, may be affected by potential tax law changes, the completion of various phases of the reit conversion plan and other factors beyond our control. the special dividend was paid in the aggregate of 20% in cash and 80% in shares of our common stock. we may decide, based on our cash flows and strategic plans, irs revenue procedures relating to distributions of earnings and profits, leverage and other factors, to pay the remaining portion of the e&amp;p distribution entirely in cash or a different mix of cash and common stock. we may be required to borrow funds and/or raise equity to satisfy our e&amp;p distribution and other conversion costs. depending on the ultimate size and timing of the stockholder distributions and the cash outlays associated with our conversion to a reit, we may raise debt and/or issue equity in the near-term to fund these disbursements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings or offerings. whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. furthermore, satisfying our e&amp;p distribution and other conversion costs may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. as a result, our indebtedness could increase. see "risks relating to our indebtedness" for further information regarding our substantial indebtedness. there are uncertainties relating to the costs associated with implementing the conversion plan. we have provided an estimated range of our tax and other costs to convert to a reit, including estimated tax liabilities associated with a change in our method of depreciating and amortizing various assets and annual compliance costs. our estimate of these taxes and other costs, however, may not be accurate, and such costs may in actuality be materially different from our estimates due to unanticipated outcomes in the plr, changes in our business support functions and support costs, the unsuccessful execution of internal planning, including restructurings and cost reduction initiatives, or other factors. we have no experience operating as a reit, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we successfully convert to a reit. we have no experience operating as a reit and our senior management has no experience operating a reit. our pre-reit operating experience may not be sufficient to prepare us to operate successfully as a reit. our inability to operate successfully as a reit, including the failure to maintain reit status, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. operational risks our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than 18 table of contents paper documents. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk. u.s. federal government initiatives have resulted in many health care providers adopting programs to evolve to greater use of electronic medical records. in addition, as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records we store become less active and more archived. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. the adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents we store. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all u.s. states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. in addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect our business. one u.s. state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in some instances european data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. for example, in the past the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. in addition, the european commission has proposed a new regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. it is anticipated that the new proposal will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as iron mountain, that process data of citizens of members of the european union. the continued emphasis on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. 19 table of contents our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability under our dms services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. as stored records become less active our core service revenue growth may decline. our core service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. as a result, while customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes thereby reducing their core service activity levels. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as iron mountain, for their future storage and information management services needs. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our u.s. government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. selling our services to the u.s. government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future u.s. government contracting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial position. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; 20 table of contents uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies or because competitors attract our customers; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2012, we provided services in more than 30 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and u.s. regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; differences in business practices; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2012, we operated 938 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 569 in the united states alone. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to iron mountain's real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current 21 table of contents specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. where we believe the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures which may involve considerable expense to iron mountain. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. 22 table of contents risks related to our common stock there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends. our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. however, our ability to pay dividends will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein occur. in addition, any determination by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and strategy and our board of directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. the terms of our revolving credit facility and term loan facility and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends subject to certain limitations. for these reasons, among others, our cash dividend rate may decline or we may cease paying dividends. risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. the following table shows important credit statistics as of december 31, 2012 (dollars in millions): total long-term debt $ 3,825.0 total equity $ 1,162.4 debt to equity ratio 3.29 x our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions, to fund the conversion plan and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness or the payment of quarterly dividends; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; 23 table of contents create or permit liens; and make capital expenditures and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. acquisition and expansion risks failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations. 24 table of contents we may be unable to continue our international expansion. part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 68 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily u.s. treasuries) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2012 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and two "triple a" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. as of december 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $277.0 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $218.6 million. a substantial portion of the money market funds is invested in u.s. treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2012, we had $519.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.2%, and $3,305.7 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2012, approximately 86.4% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2012 would have been reduced by approximately $4.5 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2012. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. 68 table of contents dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition, iron mountain switzerland gmbh, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or imim to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, continental europe and canada. specifically, through our 150.0 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255.0 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and its 175.0 million cad denominated 7 1 / 2 % senior subordinated notes due 2017. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $4.4 million ($2.7 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2012. as of december 31, 2012, cumulative net gains of $10.7 million, net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. we have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2012, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $201.2 million u.s. dollars and sell 125.0 million british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with our european operations. as of december 31, 2012, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $77.3 million u.s. dollars and sell 75.0 million australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our australian subsidiary. at the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation through other expense (income), net. during the year ended december 31, 2012, there was $9.1 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net losses in connection with these forward contracts of $13.0 million (including an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million related to certain british pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million related to the australian dollar forward contract in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2012, respectively. as 69 table of contents of december 31, 2012, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2012 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $88.8 million.risk factors 15

development of business. we store records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage. we offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000 clients throughout north america, europe, latin america and the asia pacific region. we have a diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2013, we operated in 36 countries on five continents and employed over 19,500 people. now in our 63rd year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a u.s. business operating fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of $104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with over 1,000 facilities (66.9 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index, and as of december 31, 2013 we were number 644 on the fortune 1000. we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. our current strategy is focused on: (i) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, australia and western europe through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (ii) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region (excluding australia), primarily through acquisitions; and (iii) continuing to identify, incubate and scale emerging business opportunities to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. there are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. we also expect to invest in the acquisitions of customer relationships and acquisitions of storage and information management services businesses. in our developed markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. we also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through emerging business opportunities. at this stage in our evolution we have completed the initial optimization of our existing business operations. consisting of productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements and cost controls, our 1 table of contents optimization strategy has produced significant and visible results. first, between 2006 and 2010, we focused on the north american business segment, our largest business, and drove nearly 800 basis points of improvement in that segment's adjusted oibda margin (as defined below). since 2010, our objective has been to sustain this segment's high margins while investing to support the revenue growth. following the optimization of our north american business segment, and using many of the same initiatives and techniques, we achieved 700 basis points of improvement in the adjusted oibda margins of our international business segment between 2010 and 2013. beyond 2013, we expect to grow our consolidated adjusted oibda margins at a much slower rate. in our developed markets, continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest margin improvement, a portion of which we expect to reinvest in our business. in our existing emerging markets, margins should expand as the local businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. further growth in our international margins will likely be limited as we seek to add new emerging markets to the portfolio. additionally, since 2006, we improved capital efficiency and reduced our capital expenditures (excluding real estate and reit costs, as defined below) as a percent of revenues from 13.4% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2013. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) intangible impairments, (3) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net and (4) costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest, the work of the former strategic review special committee of our board of directors (the "special committee") and the proposed reit conversion, discussed below (collectively "reit costs"). adjusted oibda margin is defined as adjusted oibda as a percent of revenues. for more detailed definitions and reconciliations of adjusted oibda and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non-gaap measures" of this annual report. we are committed to delivering stockholder value. to that end, and supported by our increased profitability and strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in february 2010 and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. our first ever quarterly cash dividend, declared in march 2010, was $0.0625 per share. we have since increased our quarterly dividend on three occasions, including most recently in june 2012, when we announced an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend payments through 2013. the june 2012 increase to our quarterly dividend, to $0.27 per share, represented a 332% increase over the quarterly dividend amount declared in march 2010. in april 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan to increase stockholder value. a major component of that plan was our commitment to significant stockholder payouts of $2.2 billion through 2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out by may 2012. we fulfilled the commitment to return $1.2 billion of cash to stockholders by may 2012. the remaining $1.0 billion of the stockholder payout plan has been replaced by our regular quarterly dividends and the stockholder distributions and expenditures associated with our plan to convert to a reit (the "conversion plan"). since may 2012 we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to stockholders including $490.5 million in cash and $560.0 million in common stock. as part of this earlier strategic plan, in june 2011, we completed the sale of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and ediscovery solutions businesses (the "digital business") for approximately $395.4 million in cash. additionally, in connection with our strategic portfolio review of certain international operations, we sold our new zealand operations in october 2011, and we sold our italian operations in april 2012. potential reit conversion in june 2012, we announced our intention to pursue conversion to a reit. the conversion plan was unanimously approved by our board of directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies, and 2 table of contents after the unanimous approval of the special committee. our conversion plan includes submitting plr requests to the irs. our plr requests have multiple components, and the conversion to a reit will require favorable rulings from the irs on numerous technical tax issues, including the characterization of our racking structure assets as real estate. we submitted our plr requests to the irs during the third quarter of 2012, but the irs may not provide a favorable response to our plr requests until sometime in 2014, or at all. even though we have not yet determined if we will be able to convert to a reit, we began operating our business in a manner consistent with being a reit effective january 1, 2014 so that we and our stockholders will benefit from our status (our "reit status") as a reit under the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code") in 2014 if we are ultimately successful in becoming a reit for 2014. any reit election made by us must be effective as of the beginning of a taxable year; therefore, if, as a calendar year taxpayer, we are unable to convert to a reit effective january 1, 2014, the next possible conversion date would be january 1, 2015. our ability to qualify as a reit will depend upon our continuing compliance following our conversion to a reit with various requirements, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit, we will be subject to u.s. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. even if we qualify for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the u.s. federal income tax regime for reits described above, many states do not completely follow u.s. federal rules and some may not follow them at all. we will continue to make estimated tax payments in compliance with applicable corporate u.s. federal income tax laws and regulations until we are successful in converting to a reit. we believe that electing reit status will maximize our enterprise value as we advance our strategy and provide significant benefits to our stockholders. a key component of our capital allocation strategy is to return excess cash to our stockholders, and we believe operating as a reit aligns well with this strategy. in november 2012, we paid a $700.0 million special dividend (the "special dividend") representing the initial distribution to satisfy the requirement that we pay to stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits which is estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion (the "e&amp;p distribution") in connection with our potential conversion to a reit. the special dividend consisted of $140.0 million paid in cash and $560.0 million in common stock value. we issued 17.0 million new shares in connection with the special dividend. we also believe that through conversion to a reit we may be able to expand our shareholder base and lower our cost of financing through increased ownership of currently leased real estate. we expect our long-term capital allocation strategy as a reit will naturally shift toward increased use of equity to support lower leverage, though our leverage may increase in the short-term to fund the costs to support the conversion plan. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview" and " liquidity and capital resources" of this annual report for more information regarding our possible conversion to a reit, including anticipated costs associated with the conversion plan, and item 1a. "risk factors risks related to the proposed reit conversion" of this annual report for a discussion of risks associated with our conversion to a reit, including impediments to a conversion. b. description of business. overview we provide cost-effective secure storage for all major media, including paper (which is the primary form of records storage we provide), as well as secure off-site storage of data backup media. our related information management services can be broadly divided into two major categories: records and 3 table of contents information management services and data management services. media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. we define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints. electronic records include e-mail and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes, hard drives and optical disks. our records and information management services include: flexible retrieval access, retention management, including the destruction of documents stored in our records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods, and records management program development and implementation based on best practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements and policy-based programs. also included within records and information management services are our secure shredding services and our scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, or document management solutions ("dms"). shredding services involve the secure shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. this service typically includes the scheduled pick-up of loose office records, which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers that we provide, and the on-site destruction of those records in specially designed vehicles or the off-site destruction at one of our secure shred plants. dms helps organizations gain better access to, and ultimately control over, their paper records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information lifecycle solutions. within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services. in addition to our core records and information management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services relating to storage and information management. our data management services include the secure handling and transportation of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus as well as disaster preparedness, planning and support. we also provide secure destruction of media and it equipment. our technology-based data management services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. since our sale of the digital business, we offer these technology-based services primarily through partnerships. additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information. physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. a large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. these are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with, and serviced by, a storage and information management services vendor. special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they 4 table of contents face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. growth of market we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. we believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. acquisitions in a highly fragmented industry the storage and information management services industry has long been and remains a highly fragmented industry with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. we believe this acquisition activity, which is ongoing, is due to the opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. attractive acquisition opportunities, many of which are small, in north america and internationally continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders. characteristics of our business we generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base in 66.9 million square feet of real estate around the globe and providing to our customers an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue growth. services are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, dms, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), and recurring project revenues. shredding consists primarily of the 5 table of contents scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations and the sale of recycled paper resulting from shredding services. in general, our north american business and our international business segments offer storage and the information management services discussed below, in their respective geographies. the amount of revenues derived from our north american business and international business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. secure storage renting secure space to customers for the purpose of storing paper records and data backup media is by far our largest source of revenue. records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. the secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs and storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis. hard copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time with limited activity in cartons packed by the customer. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security. vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. vital records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. service offerings our services can be broadly divided into two major categories: records and information management services and data management services. we offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records and information management and data management categories. records and information management services central to any records management program is the handling and transportation of stored records and the eventual destruction of those records upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. this is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. our other records and information management services include shredding services, dms services, compliant records management and consulting services, health information storage and management solutions, entertainment services, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media and include adding records to storage, temporarily removing records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanently withdrawing records from storage and destroying records. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location, and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2013, our fleet consisted of approximately 3,800 owned or leased vehicles. our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations. secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services, completing the 6 table of contents lifecycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of archival records. these services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the u.s., canada, the united kingdom, ireland, australia and latin america. the focus of our dms business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our dms services complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that integrate and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their edm solutions. we offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. for example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. in addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises. we also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons. other services that we provide include fulfillment and professional consulting services. fulfillment services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary, iron mountain fulfillment services, inc. ("imfs"). imfs stores marketing literature and other materials for its customers and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations based on current and prospective customer needs. in addition, imfs assembles custom marketing packages and orders and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. a growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by imfs. digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with variable messages, graphics and content. we provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive storage and information management programs. our consulting business draws on our experience in storage solutions and information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs to store records and manage information. our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction. 7 table of contents the growth rate of critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. we continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth. we sold our domain name management product line in 2010 and the digital business, including our former wholly owned subsidiaries, mimosa systems, inc. and stratify, inc., and our new zealand operations in 2011. also, we sold our italian operations in april 2012. consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we eliminated all revenues associated with these businesses, which have all been reflected as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, from the calculation of our internal growth rates for 2011, 2012 and 2013. data management services our data management services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with regard to disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. we provide data management services for both physical and electronic records. we also offer technology escrow services in this category. physical data management services consist of the rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. online backup is a web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. after the sale of the digital business, we continue to offer this service pursuant to a reseller agreement with autonomy corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of england and wales ("autonomy"). through our technology escrow services business, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets such as software source code, object code and data in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. the result is increased control and leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage. financial characteristics of our business our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting adjusted oibda allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business has the following financial characteristics: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage rental fees have grown for 25 consecutive years. during the three years 2011 through 2013, 8 table of contents storage rental revenues, which are stable and recurring, have increased from approximately 56% to 59% of our total consolidated revenues. this stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and adjusted oibda. historically non-cyclical storage rental business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. however, during the most recent economic downturn, which was more severe and lasted longer than other recent downturns, destruction rates increased as some customers were more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower storage rental costs in the long-term. in addition, we experienced longer sales cycles and lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and generally lower levels of business activity. combined, these impacts resulted in lower net volume growth rates. the net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage rental revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 2%, 3% and 6% on a global basis for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. inherent growth from existing physical records customers. our physical records customers have, on average, sent us additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. however, during the most recent economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers and increased destruction rates, as described above, resulted in lower consolidated net volume growth in recent quarters, including negative net volume growth from existing customers at times in certain markets. since reaching unusually high levels in 2009, our destruction rates have stabilized at rates closer to historical norms. following improvement in the economy, we expect our growth from existing customers will improve, although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. we believe the continued growth of our physical records storage rental revenues is the result of a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2013, we had over 155,000 clients in a variety of industries in 36 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the fortune 1000. no single customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. for each of the three years 2011 through 2013, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 3%. capital expenditures related primarily to business line growth and ongoing operations. our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected storage rental revenue and service revenue growth and ongoing operations, new products and services and increased profitability. as the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. every year we expend capital to support a number of different objectives. the majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. additionally, we invest capital to acquire or construct real estate. we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. these expenditures are generally relatively small and discretionary in 9 table of contents nature. below are descriptions of the major types of capital expenditures we are likely to make in a given year: capital to support business line growth these expenditures are primarily related to capacity expansion such as investments in new racking structures, carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins and technology service storage and processing capacity. capital to acquire/construct real estate these expenditures are directly related to the acquisition of real estate, either through the purchase or construction of a new facility or the buyout of an existing lease. capital to support ongoing business operations these expenditures are primarily related to major repairs and/or the replacement of assets, such as facilities, warehouse equipment and computers. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. capital for new product development these expenditures are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition. capital for product improvement these expenditures are primarily related to product and service enhancements that support our leadership position in the industry. spending in this area includes items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements. capital to support operational efficiencies these expenditures are primarily related to driving increased profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies and include items such as facility consolidations and systems to support operating process improvements. following is a table presenting our capital expenditures for 2011, 2012 and 2013 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (dollars in

(3) capital expended in support of ongoing business operations includes amounts previously referred to as maintenance capital expenditures. this category includes capital expended on operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. 10 table of contents we believe that capital expenditures, net of real estate and capital expenditures that are part of our reit costs, incurred as a percent of revenues is a meaningful metric for investors because it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the growth and operational efficiency of our business. for the years 2011 through 2013, our total capital expenditures, net of real estate and capital expenditures that are part of our reit costs, incurred as a percent of revenues were approximately 6.6%, 6.1% and 7.4%, respectively. the increase in 2013 is due primarily to capital expenditures associated with recent acquisitions, the relocation of our boston headquarters and certain capital projects that were accelerated from 2014 into 2013. following is a table presenting our capital expenditures as a percent of total revenues for 2011, 2012 and 2013 organized by the nature of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend 2011(1)(2) 2012(1)(2) 2013(1)(2) business line growth 2.7 % 2.0 % 2.4 % real estate 0.7 % 1.8 % 2.2 % business operations(3) 2.8 % 2.5 % 3.0 % product development 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % product improvement 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.4 % operational efficiencies 0.6 % 1.4 % 2.2 % total capital 7.2 % 8.3 % 10.3 % less: real estate and reit capital expenditures (0.7 )% (2.2 )% (2.9 )% total capital, net of real estate and reit capital expenditures 6.6 % 6.1 % 7.4 % (1) represents capital expenditures on an accrual basis and may differ from amounts presented on the cash basis in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. growth strategy we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services and data management services. we have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. we expect to maintain a leadership position in the storage and information management services industry around the world by enabling customers to store, protect and better use their information regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and attracting new customers. our near-term growth objectives include a set of specific initiatives: (i) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, australia and western europe through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (ii) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region 11 table of contents (excluding australia), primarily through acquisitions; and (iii) continuing to identify, incubate and scale emerging business opportunities to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions and pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses and developing ancillary businesses. introduction of new products and services we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth from existing customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. however, during the most recent economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, resulted in lower consolidated net volume growth in recent quarters, including negative net volume growth from existing customers at times in certain markets. since reaching unusually high levels in 2009, our destruction rates have stabilized at rates closer to historical norms. following the improvement in the economy, we expect our growth from existing customers will improve, although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets within our existing customer relationships. these services and products include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). expanding new and existing customer relationships our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of related services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our u.s. and international marketing organizations and senior management. growth through acquisitions the goal of our acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to expand our presence in targeted emerging markets, continuing to make fold-in acquisitions in developed markets and expanding our rental streams, new service capabilities and industry-specific services. we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating storage and information management services companies. acquisitions in developed markets we have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the united states, canada, australia and western 12 table of contents europe. given the relatively small size of most acquisition targets in our core physical businesses in these markets, where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. occasionally, however, we may be presented with the opportunity to acquire one of the larger businesses in these markets and will evaluate each opportunity with a focus on return on invested capital and the creation of stockholder value. such was the case with our acquisition in october 2013 of cornerstone records management, llc and its affiliates ("cornerstone"). acquisitions in the emerging markets we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the united states, canada, australia and western europe. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our emerging market acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into more than 35 countries. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition, we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. we now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. in connection with the strategic review of certain of our international businesses, we sold our new zealand operations in october 2011 and our italian operations in april 2012. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. the amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements. for the years ended december 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we derived approximately 34%, 35% and 36%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we had long-lived assets of approximately 36%, 37% and 36%, respectively, outside of the u.s. competition we are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 36 countries. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as iron mountain for their future storage and information management services. 13 table of contents we also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. the physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom and optical disk and use of the cloud for electronic data. to date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the primary means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records as paper documents. we continue to provide additional services such as online backup, primarily through partnerships, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. employees as of december 31, 2013, we employed over 8,500 employees in the u.s. and over 11,000 employees outside of the u.s. at december 31, 2013, an aggregate of 529 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and three provinces in canada. all union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans, except for certain unionized employees in california, who receive these types of benefits through the unions. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include: medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our dms services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from 14 table of contents liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under the "for investors" section on our internet website, we make available free of charge, our annual reports on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, our current reports on form 8-k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the sec. we are not including the information contained on or available through our website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this annual report on form 10-k. copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of ethics and the charters of our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees are available on the "for investors" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." item 1a. risk factors. our businesses face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. 15 table of contents risks related to the proposed reit conversion although we have chosen to pursue conversion to a reit, we may not be successful in converting to a reit effective as of january 1, 2014, or at all. as previously announced in june 2012, our board of directors unanimously approved the conversion plan to pursue conversion to a reit under the code. we are in the process of implementing the conversion plan, pursuant to which we would elect reit status no earlier than our taxable year beginning january 1, 2014. one of the conditions that must be met in order to complete our conversion to a reit is obtaining favorable plrs from the irs. our plr requests have multiple components, and our conversion to a reit will require favorable rulings from the irs on a number of technical tax issues, including the characterization of our racking structures as real estate (the "racking structure request"). in this regard, in the course of our communications with the irs relating to our plr requests, we disclosed in june 2013 that the irs informed us that it formed an internal working group to study the legal standards the irs uses to define "real estate" for purposes of the reit provisions of the code and what changes or refinements, if any, should be made to those legal standards. the irs also informed us that it was "tentatively adverse" to ruling that our racking structures constitute "real estate" for reit purposes. in november 2013, the irs stated that it will resume issuing rulings regarding the definition of "real estate" for purposes of the reit provisions of the code, and the irs is continuing to evaluate our plr requests, including the racking structure request. we can provide no assurance that the irs will ultimately provide us with a favorable plr on the racking structure request or our other plr requests, or that any favorable plr will be received in a timely manner for us to convert successfully to a reit effective january 1, 2014. there are other significant implementation and operational complexities to address in connection with converting to a reit, including obtaining favorable plrs from the irs as discussed above, completing internal reorganizations relating to certain of our international operations, testing and validating accounting, information technology and real estate system modifications implemented in connection with the conversion plan, receiving stockholder approvals, and making required stockholder payouts, and the timing and outcome of many of these are outside our control. further, changes in legislation or the federal tax rules could adversely impact our ability to convert to a reit and/or the attractiveness of converting to a reit. similarly, even if we are able to satisfy the existing reit requirements, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time in ways that could be disadvantageous to us. even if the transactions necessary to implement reit conversion are successfully effected, including receipt of favorable plrs, our board of directors may decide not to elect reit status, or to delay such election, if it determines in its sole discretion that it is not in the best interests of our stockholders. while we have not yet determined if we will be able to convert to a reit, we have determined that we will begin to operate our business in a manner consistent with being a reit effective january 1, 2014 so that we and our stockholders will benefit from our reit status in 2014 if we are ultimately successful in becoming a reit effective in 2014. however, we can provide no assurance if or when conversion to a reit will be successful. furthermore, if we do convert, the effective date of the reit conversion could be delayed beyond january 1, 2014, in which event we could not elect reit status until the taxable year beginning january 1, 2015, at the earliest. we may not qualify or remain qualified as a reit, and/or may not realize the anticipated benefits to stockholders, including the achievement of tax savings for us, increases in income distributable to stockholders, the potential to lower our cost of financing through increased ownership of currently leased real estate and the expansion of our stockholder base. if we convert to a reit, we plan to operate in a manner consistent with reit qualification rules; however, we cannot provide assurance that we will, in fact, qualify as a reit or remain so qualified. reit qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code, to 16 table of contents our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. even if we are successful converting to a reit and electing reit status, we cannot provide assurance that our stockholders will experience benefits attributable to our qualification and taxation as a reit, including our ability to (1) reduce our corporate level federal tax through distributions to stockholders, (2) lower our cost of financing or (3) expand our stockholder base. the realization of the anticipated benefits to stockholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside our control, including interest rates. in addition, future distributions to stockholders will depend on our cash flows, as well as the impact of alternative, more attractive investments as compared to dividends. further, changes in legislation or the federal tax rules could adversely impact the benefits of being a reit. complying with reit qualification requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, and to remain so qualified, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. for example, under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more u.s. taxable reit subsidiaries ("trs") and other nonqualifying assets. this limitation may affect our ability to make large investments in other non-reit qualifying operations or assets. as such, compliance with reit tests may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of significant nonqualifying assets and the material expansion of non-real estate activities. there are uncertainties relating to our estimate of our e&amp;p distribution, as well as the timing of such e&amp;p distribution and the percentage of common stock and cash we may distribute. we have provided an estimated range of the e&amp;p distribution. we are in the process of conducting a study of our pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of our 2012 taxable year using our historical tax returns and other available information. this is a very involved and complex study that is not yet complete, and the actual result of the study relating to our pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of our 2012 taxable year may be materially different from our current estimates. in addition, the estimated range of our e&amp;p distribution is based on our projected taxable income for our 2013 taxable year and our current business plans and performance, but our actual earnings and profits (and the actual amount of the e&amp;p distribution) will vary depending on, among other items, the timing of certain transactions, our actual taxable income and performance for 2013 and possible changes in legislation or tax rules and irs revenue procedures relating to distributions of earnings and profits. for these reasons and others, our actual e&amp;p distribution may be materially different from our estimated range. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we paid to our stockholders a special dividend of $700 million, which represented the initial portion of the expected e&amp;p distribution. we expect the balance of the e&amp;p distribution will be paid in 2014 if we successfully convert to a reit, but the timing of the planned payment of the remaining e&amp;p distribution, which may or may not occur, may be affected by the completion of various phases of the conversion plan and other factors beyond our control. the special dividend was paid in the aggregate of 20% in cash and 80% in shares of our common stock. we may decide, based on our cash flows and strategic plans, irs revenue procedures relating to distributions of earnings and profits, leverage and other factors, to pay the remaining portion of the e&amp;p distribution entirely in cash or a different mix of cash and common stock. 17 table of contents we may be required to borrow funds and/or raise equity to satisfy our e&amp;p distribution. depending on the ultimate size and timing of the stockholder distributions, we may raise debt and/or issue equity in the near-term to fund these disbursements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings or offerings. whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. furthermore, satisfying our e&amp;p distribution and other conversion costs may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. as a result, our indebtedness could increase. see "risks relating to our indebtedness" for further information regarding our substantial indebtedness. our reit status protection rights agreement may not protect our potential status as a reit and could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in december 2013 we entered into a reit status protection rights agreement (the "rights agreement") with computershare inc., as rights agent. in connection with the rights agreement, we declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a "right") for each share of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "common stock") outstanding on december 20, 2013. we entered into the rights agreement in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to provide for the preservation of our potential reit status by limiting ownership concentration that could threaten our potential reit status. however, since the exercisability of the rights, or the exchange (an "exchange") therefor by us for shares of common stock or our series a participating junior preferred stock (or another series of our preferred stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), at an exchange rate of one share of common stock, or a fractional share of preferred stock (or other stock) equivalent in value thereto, per right, is triggered only after a person or group has exceeded beneficial ownership of in excess of 9.8% of our common stock, as calculated in accordance with the rights agreement (the "ownership threshold"), the rights agreement, by its terms, cannot prevent a stockholder from exceeding the ownership threshold and thereby threatening our potential reit status. nevertheless, we expect that the potential for substantial dilution to a person or group that exceeds the ownership threshold will strongly discourage a stockholder from exceeding such ownership threshold and becoming an acquiring person, as defined in the rights agreement. while the decision by our board of directors to consider a person or group an acquiring person and/or consummate an exchange would likely reduce such acquiring person's ownership below the ownership threshold, we can provide no assurance that effecting an exchange or otherwise triggering the exercisability of the rights would retroactively remove the threat to our potential reit status that resulted from such acquiring person exceeding the ownership threshold in the first place. also, the tax consequences to a reit of triggering a rights agreement are unclear, and we can provide no assurance that we will consummate an exchange or allow the exercisability of the rights to be triggered even if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of the outstanding common stock of greater than the ownership threshold. while we have entered into the rights agreement to assist with our reit compliance under the code if we are able to convert to a reit, the rights agreement also could inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may prevent a change in our control. as a result, the overall effect of the rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. because our 18 table of contents board of directors can redeem the rights at any time in their sole discretion, the rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors. we have no experience operating as a reit, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we successfully convert to a reit. we have no experience operating as a reit and our senior management has no experience operating a reit. our pre-reit operating experience may not be sufficient to prepare us to operate successfully as a reit. our inability to operate successfully as a reit, including the failure to maintain reit status, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. operational risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. this storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes. these technologies include computer media, microform, cd-rom, optical disk and use of the cloud for electronic data. u.s. federal government initiatives have resulted in many health care providers adopting programs to evolve to greater use of electronic medical records. in addition, as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents or tape format. the adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents and tapes we store. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or tape based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. as stored records become less active our core service revenue growth and profitability may decline. our records management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. as a result, while we continue to experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records, thereby reducing their service activity levels. at the same time many of our costs related to records related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their information management expenditures. some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and adopting more aggressive destruction practices. if we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 19 table of contents governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. in addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all u.s. states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. in addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect our business. one u.s. state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. in some instances european data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. for example, in the past the u.s. congress has considered legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. in addition, the european commission has proposed a regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. it is anticipated that the proposed regulation will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as iron mountain, that process data of residents of members of the european union and substantially increase penalties for violations. also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. the continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2013, we operated 944 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 570 in the united states alone. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed in 20 table of contents compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. where we believe the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures which may involve considerable expense to us. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability under our dms services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, there is no assurance we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our u.s. government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. selling our services to the u.s. government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future u.s. government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2013, we provided services in 35 countries outside the u.s. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and u.s. regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular, iron mountain is subject to u.s. and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; 21 table of contents the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the u.s. will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies or because competitors attract our customers; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and 22 table of contents failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe storms and hurricanes and our key facilities in florida and other coastal areas in particular are subject to this inherent risk. damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology systems or security breaches involving iron mountain could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. 23 table of contents we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as iron mountain, for their future storage and information management service needs. risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2013, our total long-term debt was approximately $4.17 billion, our stockholders' equity was approximately $1.06 billion and our cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) totaled approximately $0.15 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions, to fund the conversion plan and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness or the payment of quarterly dividends; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make acquisitions and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. 24 table of contents we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned u.s. subsidiaries. acquisition and expansion risks elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks. as part of our strategic growth plan, we have undergone a significant management reorganization, and we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. for example, in 2013 we expanded our entry into the data center market by leasing wholesale and retail colocation space in our underground facility in pennsylvania, and we broke ground on our first regional data center in northborough, massachusetts, which required a significant capital commitment. many of these new ventures are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the u.s. or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. 25 table of contents failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the u.s. we also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. risks related to our common stock there is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends. our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. however, our ability to pay dividends will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein occur. in addition, any determination by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and strategy and our board of directors' continuing determination that the 26 table of contents declaration of dividends under the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. the terms of our credit facility and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends subject to certain limitations. for these reasons, among others, our cash dividend rate may decline or we may cease paying dividends. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 66 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily u.s. treasuries) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2013 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with one global bank and one "triple a" rated money market fund, which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. as of december 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $154.4 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $36.6 million. a substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in u.s. treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will 66 table of contents use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2013, we had $676.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.73%, and $3,495.0 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2013, approximately 84% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2013 would have been reduced by approximately $3.3 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2013. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our u.s.-based subsidiaries. in addition, iron mountain switzerland gmbh, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or iron mountain information management, llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, continental europe and canada. specifically, through our 150.0 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 / 4 % senior subordinated notes due 2014 and our 255.0 million 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in british pounds sterling and euros. canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and its 200.0 million cad denominated 6 1 / 8 % senior notes due 2021. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % euro senior subordinated notes due 2018 issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $5.3 million ($3.2 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2013, cumulative net gains of $7.5 million, net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. 67 table of contents we have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to british pounds sterling, australian dollars and euros. as of december 31, 2013, we had (1) outstanding forward contracts to purchase $206.1 million u.s. dollars and sell 127.5 million british pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with our european operations; (2) an outstanding forward contract to purchase $62.3 million u.s. dollars and sell 70.0 million australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our australian subsidiary and (3) outstanding forward contracts to purchase 93.0 million euros and sell $127.2 million u.s. dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our united kingdom operations. at the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation through other expense (income), net. during the year ended december 31, 2013, there was $7.0 million in net cash receipts included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net gains in connection with these forward contracts of $3.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million related to the australian dollar forward contracts, and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $4.5 million related to certain british pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million related to the euro forward contract in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2013, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2013 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $68.0 million.risk

business overview we store records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage. we offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. founded in an underground facility near hudson, new york in 1951, iron mountain incorporated, a delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000 customers throughout north america, europe, latin america and the asia pacific region. we have a diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 92% of the fortune 1000. as of december 31, 2014, we operated in 36 countries on five continents and employed over 20,000 people. now in our 64th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in february 1996. we have grown from a u.s. business operating fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of $104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with approximately 1,100 facilities (67.8 million square feet) as of december 31, 2014 and total revenues of more than $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. on january 5, 2009, we were added to the s&amp;p 500 index. on november 28 2014, we were added to the msci reit index and as of december 31, 2014 we were number 712 on the fortune 1000. reit conversion we are committed to delivering stockholder value. to that end, and supported by our strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in february 2010 and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. in april 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan to increase stockholder value. a major component of that plan was our commitment to significant stockholder payouts of $2.2 billion through 2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out by may 2012. we fulfilled the commitment to return $1.2 billion of cash to stockholders by may 2012, and in june 2012, we announced our intention to pursue conversion to a reit. the plan was unanimously approved by our board of directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies. since may 2012, we have returned $2.1 billion of capital to stockholders including $1.0 billion in cash and $1.1 billion in our common stock. as part of our plan to convert to a reit for federal income tax purposes and elect reit status effective january 1, 2014, we sought private letter rulings ("plrs") from the united states internal revenue service (the "irs") relating to numerous technical tax issues, including classification of our steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets. we submitted the plr requests in the third quarter of 2012, and on june 25, 2014, we announced that we received the favorable plrs from the irs necessary for our conversion to a reit. after receipt of the plrs, our board of directors unanimously approved our conversion to a reit for our taxable year beginning january 1, 2014. in connection with our conversion to a reit and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for reits, on january 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our predecessor and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal 1 table of contents number of shares of our common stock. accordingly, references herein to our "common stock" refer to our common stock and the common stock of our predecessor, as applicable. the durability of our business we believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the internet. these technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. in addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. we believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. business strategy overview we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. our current strategy is focused on: (1) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the united states, canada, australia and western europe, primarily through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (2) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region (excluding australia), primarily through acquisitions; and (3) continuing to identify, incubate and scale emerging business opportunities to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. in our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest profit growth, a portion of which we expect to reinvest in our business. in our existing emerging markets, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. however, any increases in our international profits will be limited as we seek to make acquisitions in new emerging markets. storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. there are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. we also expect to invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. in our developed markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. we also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through emerging business opportunities. 2 table of contents we offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services and data management services. we have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. we expect to maintain a leadership position in the storage and information management services industry around the world by enabling customers to store, protect and better use their information regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and attracting new customers. our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions, pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses, and developing ancillary businesses and real estate. we continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. growth from existing and new customers our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional records at a faster rate than old records are destroyed or permanently removed. the growth in new records volume from our existing customers has been consistent in the past three years, and we anticipate this growth will be sustained, although we cannot give any assurance as to whether this growth will continue. in order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service. our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets. our sales force is dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of related services and products. in order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our united states and international marketing organizations and senior management. we are developing tailored marketing strategies to target customers in the healthcare, financial, insurance, legal, life sciences, energy, business services and federal vertical market segments. growth through acquisitions the storage and information management services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. after 2004, acquisition activity was reduced as we focused on integrating these recent transactions and diversifying the business. beginning again in 2012, we saw opportunities for attractive acquisitions in emerging markets and consolidation opportunities in more developed markets, and resumed acquisition activity. we believe this ongoing acquisition activity is due to opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. attractive acquisition opportunities, in north america and internationally, many of which are small, continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders. lastly, we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating these businesses. 3 table of contents we have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the united states, canada, australia and western europe. given the relatively small size of most attractive acquisition targets in these markets, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. occasionally, however, we may be presented with the opportunity to acquire one of the larger businesses in these markets and will evaluate each opportunity with a focus on return on invested capital and the creation of stockholder value. such was the case with our acquisition in october 2013 of cornerstone records management, llc and its affiliates. we expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the united states, canada, australia and western europe. we have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. we expect that future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern europe, latin america and the asia pacific region. the experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our emerging market acquisition strategy. since beginning our international expansion program in january 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 35 countries. these transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. we believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. the local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. in addition to the criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. we now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. business characteristics. we generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base in approximately 1,100 facilities representing 67.8 million square feet of real estate as of december 31, 2014 around the globe and providing to our customers an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue growth. services are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, document management solutions ("dms"), data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), and recurring project revenues. shredding consists primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations and the sale of recycled paper resulting from shredding services. 4 table of contents secure storage our storage operations consist of providing non-dedicated storage rental space to our customers. non-dedicated space allows our customers to increase or decrease the volume of their physical storage over the life of the contract based on their storage needs, while also reducing their risk of loss in the event of natural disaster. given this non-dedicated space dynamic, the large portfolio of customer contracts, and the fact that no customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues as of the year ended december 31, 2014, we assess the performance of our storage rental business predominantly by analyzing trends in segment level storage rental volume and storage rental revenue. renting secure space to customers for the purpose of storing paper records and data backup media is our largest source of revenue. records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. the secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs, and storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis. hard copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time with limited activity in cartons packed by the customer. for some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security. physical records may also include critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. we continue to identify additional areas of physical storage that fit with our core competencies in security and transportation, seeking to provide enterprise storage to businesses in much the same manner that self-storage companies serve consumers. physical records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for these vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. physical records physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. physical data management services consist of the rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. we also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. electronic records electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. we believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they 5 table of contents face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. it is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to offsite locations on a regular basis and to store multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. in addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. online backup is an internet-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the internet and stores it in secure data centers. service offerings central to any records management program is the handling and transportation and the eventual destruction of records upon the expiration of retention periods. these activities are accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. as of december 31, 2014, our courier fleet consisted of approximately 3,600 owned or leased vehicles. our other services include secure shredding, dms, compliant records management and consulting services, health information storage and management solutions, entertainment services, energy data services, discovery services and other ancillary services. our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations and typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. in addition, secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services by completing the lifecycle of a record and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us. complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the united states, canada and latin america. in december 2014, we sold our secure shredding businesses in the united kingdom, ireland and australia, which were much smaller than our operation in north america, because we did not benefit from scale in these markets. the focus of our dms business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. we seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. our dms services complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. we differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that complement and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. the trend towards increased usage of electronic document management ("edm") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. our dms services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their edm solutions. we offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as healthcare, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. for example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. in addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. 6 table of contents recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. we offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. these services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. we also provide services for the management of active records programs. we can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both offsite at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at a customer's premises. other services that we provide include fulfillment, professional consulting services, and technology escrow services. business segments our north american records and information management business, north american data management business, and our international business segments offer storage and the information management services discussed above, in their respective geographies. the amount of revenues derived from our north american records and information management business, north american data management business, international business, and corporate and other segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014 are set forth in note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. north american records and information management business our north american records and information management business segment consists of storage and information management services throughout the united states and canada, including the storage of paper documents, as well as other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, x-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("records management"); information destruction services ("destruction"); dms; fulfillment services; and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code. north american data management business our north american data management business segment consists of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans throughout the united states and canada, including service and courier operations ("data protection &amp; recovery"), server and computer backup services, digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. international business our international business segment consists of storage and information management services throughout europe, latin america and asia pacific, including records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms. our european operations provide records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms throughout europe. our latin america operations provide records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms throughout argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, mexico and peru. our asia pacific operations provide records management, data protection &amp; recovery and dms throughout australia, with records management and data protection &amp; recovery also provided in certain cities in india, singapore, hong kong-sar and china. prior to december 2014, our international business segment offered destruction in the united kingdom, ireland and australia. 7 table of contents corporate and other our corporate and other segment consists of our data center business in the united states as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. these costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. our corporate and other segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plans. emerging business opportunities ("ebos") are prospective business lines that we consider investing in to grow and diversify our business. we are seeking businesses with long-term, recurring revenue, preferably with storage rental attributes, which are consistent with and will enhance our reit structure. our management team is focused on identifying and evaluating these opportunities. we have established an innovation process so we cautiously and effectively develop opportunities to leverage our capabilities. after we have demonstrated success and met return thresholds, we may potentially acquire businesses to further accelerate our growth in the relevant opportunity. importantly, the ebo process includes financial hurdles and decision gates to help us evaluate whether we scale or scrap these opportunities, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation. currently, our data center business is one example of an ebo where we are assessing the potential for additional investment. the growth rate of critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the internet as a distribution and transaction medium. the rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. our business fundamentals our business fundamentals are based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. we generate attractive returns from our differentiated storage rental business model because our occupancy costs, whether in a leased or owned building, are incurred per square foot while our storage revenue is generally earned per cubic foot. the historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting profitability allows us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. our business fundamentals consist of: recurring revenues. we derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage rental fees have grown for 26 consecutive years. this stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and profitability. a customer is allocated a certain amount of storage space in our storage facilities but is not allocated a dedicated building or space in a particular building. in practice, we can, and sometimes will, for a variety of reasons, move records from one facility and into another facility. in order to track net move-in and move-out activity of customer materials, as well as to assess the optimization of our real estate portfolio, we regularly assess the utilization of our overall real estate portfolio. on a per building basis, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the entire building assuming it was fully 8 table of contents racked ("total building utilization"). additionally, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the racking that has been installed ("total racking utilization"). as of december 31, 2014, our total building utilization and total racking utilization were approximately 83% and 91%, respectively, for our records management business and our total building utilization and total racking utilization were approximately 68% and 81%, respectively, for our data management business. we regularly offer concessions to our customers in order to generate new business opportunities. such concessions most commonly come in the form of providing free intake costs to transport a customer's records to one of our facilities, including labor and transportation costs ("move costs"), or payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate the customer's existing contract with that vendor ("permanent withdrawal fees"). we capitalize move costs and permanent withdrawal fees as customer acquisition costs. historically non-cyclical storage rental business. historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns. we believe the durability of our storage rental business is driven by a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. the growth in new records volume from our existing customers has been consistent in the past three years, and we anticipate this growth will be sustained, although we cannot give any assurance as to whether this growth will continue. total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 3%, 6% and 4% on a global basis for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. diversified and stable customer base. as of december 31, 2014, we had over 155,000 customers in a variety of industries in 36 countries around the world. we currently provide storage and information management services to legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services and government organizations, including more than 92% of the fortune 1000. no single customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. for each of the three years 2012 through 2014, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was approximately 2% to 3%. capital allocation. all the characteristics of our business noted above support the durability of our cash flows, which in turn support our dividends and a portion of our investments. absent a large acquisition or significant investments in real estate, we generally generate cash flows to support our dividends, maintain our operations and infrastructure and invest in core growth opportunities. we plan on funding acquisitions, ebo investments and real estate investments primarily through incremental borrowing at a targeted leverage ratio and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity. below are descriptions of the major types of investments and other capital expenditures that we have made in recent years or that we are likely to consider in 2015: real estate: capital expenditures for investments in real estate assets that support core business growth these expenditures are primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies. capital expenditures in real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations these expenditures are primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures. 9 table of contents non-real estate: capital expenditures for investments in non-real estate assets that support core business growth these expenditures support either (i) the growth of our business and/or an increase of our profitability by investing in either supporting assets such as carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) they are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhancements that support our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements. capital expenditures in non-real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations these expenditures are primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. this category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements. the following table presents our capital spend for 2012, 2013 and 2014 organized by the type of the spending as described above: year ended december 31, nature of capital spend (dollars in thousands) 2012(1) 2013(1) 2014(1) real estate: investment $

249,227 $ 312,007 $ 332,755 (1) represents capital expenditures on an accrual basis and may differ from amounts presented on the cash basis in the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this annual report. competition we are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 36 countries. we compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. we can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management services. we also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. the physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in north america and around the world. we believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. 10 table of contents alternative technologies we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. to date, none of the alternative technologies has replaced paper documents as the primary means for storing information. however, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or in tape format. we continue to provide, primarily through partnerships, additional services such as online backup, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high-quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. employees as of december 31, 2014, we employed more than 7,500 employees in the united states and more than 12,500 employees outside of the united states. at december 31, 2014, an aggregate of 528 employees were represented by unions in california, georgia and three provinces in canada. all union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. certain unionized employees in california receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. in addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. all union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. insurance for strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability for damages with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. our liability under our dms services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. we can provide no assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. while we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their 11 table of contents customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. environmental matters some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. we transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. corporate responsibility we are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the global reporting initiative. our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for our efforts in the community, our environment, and for our people. we are a trusted partner to more than 92% of the fortune 1000 companies. iron mountain is also a member of the fortune 1000, ranked at 712 as of december 31, 2014, as well as a member of the ftse4 good index, msci world esg index, msci acwi esg index and msci usa imi esg index in which include companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. a copy of our corporate responsibility report is available on the "company" section of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate responsibility." internet website our internet address is www.ironmountain.com . under

of our website, www.ironmountain.com , under the heading "corporate governance." 12 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities. risks related to operating as a reit if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income. we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year beginning january 1, 2014; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply. reit qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code: we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates; and we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for four taxable years following the year we were so disqualified. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced. as a reit, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax. we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions, and, to achieve maximum tax efficiency and retain cash to allow us to make selective discretionary investments, we currently anticipate our typical regular quarterly distributions will be based on a payment of approximately 100% of our reit taxable income; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to 13 table of contents fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments. to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code. we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. this would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. a downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks relating to our indebtedness." whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. in addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification. as a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders. at any time, the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more 14 table of contents significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing. we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss. as a reit, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our trss. our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability. in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements. our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified as a reit. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, we will fail to remain qualified as a reit. 15 table of contents our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. a reit generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income to its stockholders. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate. even if we remain qualified as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit. our information management services businesses are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, our international assets and operations will continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash. we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate (currently 35%) on gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally ten years) after the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2014, to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election in excess of our then tax basis. in addition, depreciation recapture income that we recognized in our 2014 taxable year and will recognize in subsequent taxable years, as a result of accounting method changes that were effective prior to january 1, 2014, has been and will be fully subject to this 35% tax. in addition, the irs and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for our pre-reit period, in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. moreover, any increase in taxable income for these pre-reit periods will likely result in an increase in pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination. complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge liabilities. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-u.s. operations do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous 16 table of contents hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future taxable income in the trss. we have limited experience operating as a reit, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock, ability to forecast dividends and ability to satisfy debt service obligations. we began operating as a reit on january 1, 2014 and, as such, have limited operating history as a reit. in addition, prior to january 1, 2014 our senior management team had no prior experience operating a reit. we can provide no assurance that our past experience has sufficiently prepared us to operate successfully as a reit. our inability to operate successfully as a reit, including the failure to maintain reit status, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates. qualifying distributions payable by corporations to individuals, trusts and estates that are united states stockholders are currently eligible for federal income tax at preferential rates. distributions payable by reits, in contrast, generally are not eligible for the preferential rates. the preferential rates applicable to regular corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-reit corporations that pay distributions, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our common stock. the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our status as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium. in order for us to remain qualified as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elect to be taxed as a reit. in addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying reit income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the code. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our reit status from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able 17 table of contents to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified as a reit. in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. the ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in the interest of our stockholders. our board of directors determines our major policies, including policies and guidelines relating to our investments, acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, operations and distributions to our stockholders. our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. operational risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space. we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or in tape format. the adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents and tapes we store. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. as stored records become less active our service revenue growth and profitability may decline. our records management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. as a result, while we continue to experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records, thereby reducing their service activity levels. at the same time many of our costs related to records related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. 18 table of contents changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their information management expenditures. some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and adopting more aggressive destruction practices. if we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, if we fail to protect our own information, including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation. in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states in the united states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached. in addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect our business. some states in the united states have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. the european commission has proposed a regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. it is anticipated that the proposed regulation and directive will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as iron mountain, that process data of residents of members of the european union and substantially increase penalties for violations. if adopted, we would be directly subject to some of these laws, and our customers, pursuant to agreements, would require us to comply with others. continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the united states. for example, the recently completed 113 th congress considered legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields, and it is anticipated that the 114 th congress will also consider such issues. also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. the continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. while we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses. in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be damaged by any 19 table of contents compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2014, we operated 977 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 561 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation. our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability under our dms and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes. failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position. selling our services to the united states government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse 20 table of contents government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation. international operations may pose unique risks. as of december 31, 2014, we provided services in 35 countries outside the united states. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular, iron mountain is subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law; the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate; political uncertainties; unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses; costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale; the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected; difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries; cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and foreign currency fluctuations. in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between our foreign subsidiaries. we have operations in multiple foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we conduct business operations in several foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which operate in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international storage and information management services businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. 21 table of contents we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business. because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include: acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets; uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities; inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies or because competitors attract our customers; and liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe storms and hurricanes and our key facilities in florida and other coastal areas in particular are subject to this inherent risk. damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology 22 table of contents systems or security breaches involving iron mountain could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations. our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations. attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our information technology and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party. third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm. we face competition for customers. we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. 23 table of contents risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014, our total long-term debt was approximately $4.66 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions; inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; loss of customers and reduced effectiveness in attracting new customers due to concerns over the levels of our debt or concern over financial ratios that are negatively impacted by our requirement to make large distributions as a reit and the impact of these on our operations; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; and make acquisitions and other investments. these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient 24 table of contents funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures. iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries. iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned united states subsidiaries. acquisition and expansion risks elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks. as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. for example, in 2013 we expanded our entry into the data center market by leasing wholesale and retail colocation space in our underground facility in pennsylvania, and in 2014 we opened our first regional data center in massachusetts, each of which required a significant capital commitment. many of these new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. failure to manage our growth may impact operating results. if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth. failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's 25 table of contents attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations. we may be unable to continue our international expansion. an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate. this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to: identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in; complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms; successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth; achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate; incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the united states. we also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 70 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily united states treasuries) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2014 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with three global banks and two "triple a" rated money market funds, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $159.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $53.0 million. the money market funds are invested substantially in united states treasuries. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. as of december 31, 2014, we had $1,134.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.7%, and $3,528.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 76% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 would have been reduced by approximately $3.7 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2014. currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd., iron mountain cis and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real, australian dollar and the russian ruble. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. 70 table of contents the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our treasury centers in switzerland, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or iron mountain information management, llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada and continental europe. ime has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in british pounds sterling under the gbp notes. similarly, canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and the cad notes. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. specifically, through our 255.0 million 6 3 / 4 % notes, we effectively hedge our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in euros. we designated a portion of our 6 3 / 4 % notes issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $6.4 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, cumulative net gains of $13.8 million, net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. we have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in euros, british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase 206.0 million euros and sell $252.7 million united states dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our european operations. at the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated forward contracts as hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2014, there was $21.1 million in net cash payments included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net losses in connection with forward contracts of $18.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million related to the euro forward contracts in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 71 table of contents functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $70.4 million.risk factors 13 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. we target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. as part of this strategy, in may 2001 and june 2006 we and ime entered into a total of two derivative financial contracts, which are variable-for-fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (b) one contract for interest payments payable on ime term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million british pounds sterling. see note 3 to notes to consolidated financial statements. after consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of december 31, 2006, we had $517.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.4%, and $2,150.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2006, 80.6% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2006 would have been reduced by $2.9 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2006. currency risk our investments in ime, iron mountain canada corporation ( im canada ), iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, imsa and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, 49 primarily the euro, canadian dollar and british pound sterling. the currencies of many latin american countries, particularly the argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the u.s. dollar will cause revenues in u.s. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. the impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and iron mountain and our u.s.-based subsidiaries and our foreign subsidiaries and ime. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the u.s. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our three foreign investments in the u.k., canada and asia pacific. specifically, through ime borrowing under the ime credit agreement and our 150 million british pounds sterling denominated 7 1 4 % senior subordinated notes, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loan with ime. im canada has financed their capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the imi revolving credit facility. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. to fund the acquisition of pickfords in australia and new zealand, iron mountain borrowed australian and new zealand dollars under its multi-currency revolving credit facility. these borrowings provided a tax efficient natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. subsequently, we repaid such borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility and contemporaneously in september 2006, we entered into forward contracts to exchange u.s. dollars for 55 million in australian dollars ( aud ) and 20.2 million in new zealand dollars ( nzd ) to hedge our intercompany exposure in these countries. in addition, in january, 2007 we entered into forward contracts to exchange u.s. dollars for 96 million euros and 194 million cad for 127.5 million euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. these forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in aud, nzd, cad and euros against the u.s. dollar. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract. as of december 31, 2006, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items, net component of stockholders equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2006 functional currencies, relative to the u.s. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $41.1 million.
