risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, the annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. in addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. our businesses face cost pressures and risks inherent in global manufacturing which could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. in the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. in addition, we are subject to risks inherent in global manufacturing, such as environmental events, labor disputes, disruption in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. we face risks associated with significant international operations. we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states. as a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. that can increase our exposure. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, china and india. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. in addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. 4 if the reputation of the company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers, or we are unable to maintain trademark protection. further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. in addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase reputational, operational and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. our business is subject to legislation, regulation and enforcement in the u.s. and abroad. changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business. this includes changes in competition, product-related, privacy and environmental laws, including actions in response to global climate change concerns, increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and enforcement penalties. accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k, may result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. in addition, as a u.s. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the u.s. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the u.s. is not taxed in the u.s., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. if these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. further, retail trade consolidation could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. in addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. we face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. if the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers and/or liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations. we could also be negatively impacted by an economic crisis in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments. such events could negatively impact our overall liquidity, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. a failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. these systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security, and other processes necessary to manage the business. if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. 5 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information, which appears on page 50, and note 5, risk management activities and fair value measurements, which appears on pages 60-62 of the 2011 annual report.risk factors. the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. the the procter &amp; gamble company 4 following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses and by focusing on the most profitable businesses, biggest innovations and most important emerging markets. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. if demand for our products and/or market growth rates in either developed or developing markets fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our volume, and consequently our results, could be negatively impacted. this could occur due to, among other things, unforeseen negative economic or political events, changes in consumer trends and habits, or negative consumer responses to pricing actions. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. this includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products in both developed and developing markets. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels, such as sales made through the internet directly to consumers, may affect customer and consumer preferences, as well as market dynamics. failure to effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation . achieving our business results depends, in part, on the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections, and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others. we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances by and intellectual property rights granted to competition, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures which could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, energy costs, pension and healthcare costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to forecast and manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects) and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. in addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results. there are risks inherent in global manufacturing which could negatively impact our business results. in the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, to achieve our targets on cost. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing, such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. we face risks associated with having significant international operations. we are a global company, with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries, and a significant portion of our revenue is outside the u.s. our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, such as the foreign corrupt practices act; compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws; changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls; discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; difficulties enforcing intellectual property and 5 the procter &amp; gamble company contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and similar restrictions on our sales outside the united states. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, china and india. in addition, some countries where we have businesses, such as argentina, have introduced import restrictions. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. we hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states are translated into u.s. dollars. our operations outside of the u.s. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition. see also the financial condition and results of operations section of the md&amp;a and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. we face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets. our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which have recently been volatile. our products are sold in more than 180 countries around the world. if the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers and/or liquidity issues resulting from an inability to access credit markets to obtain cash to support operations. our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets. any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. we could also be negatively impacted by political crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a deterioration in the credit worthiness or a default by local governments. for example, we could be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union such as greece, or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax increases and government spending restrictions potentially occurring at the end of calendar year 2012 in the united states (commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff ). consequently, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption. these risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing and borrowing costs, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. in addition, many of our brands have worldwide recognition. this recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years. the quality and safety of our products is critical to our business. our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy, or similar matters, these issues could negatively impact sentiments toward the company or our products, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. in addition, given the association of our individual products with the company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the company as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results. our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. we have executed a number of significant business the procter &amp; gamble company 6 and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. further, ongoing business and organizational changes are likely to result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase reputational, operational, and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture, and divestiture activities could impact our business results. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands. additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks associated with each joint venture we enter into. our business is subject to changes in legislation, regulation and enforcement, and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the united states and abroad. changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. as a u.s. based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the united states is not taxed in the united states, provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. if these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. in addition, our ability to manage regulatory, environmental, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal matters, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in item 3 of this form 10-k and note 10 of our consolidated financial statements, commitments and contingencies, result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. there are increasing calls in the united states from members of leadership in both major u.s. political parties for comprehensive tax reform which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to u.s. domiciled corporations, such as p&amp;g. it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for p&amp;g's earnings and cash flows. a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which consist of mass merchandisers, grocery stores, club stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and our key retailers. this would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures, local law and regulation changes, or financial distress. a failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by 7 the procter &amp; gamble company third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping product to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing, and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. if the it systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, risk management activities and fair value measurements. 33 the procter &amp; gamble company the procter

and business plans available only as of the the procter &amp; gamble company 15 time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. a change in consumer demand for our products and/or lack of market growth could have a significant impact on our business. we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by focusing on the most profitable businesses, biggest innovations and most important emerging markets. we also expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. if demand for our products and/or market growth rates in either developed or developing markets falls substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our volume, and consequently our results, could be negatively impacted. this could occur due to, among other things, unforeseen negative economic or political events, changes in consumer

there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. this includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products in both developed and developing markets. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer and consumer preferences, as well as market dynamics. failure to effectively compete in these new

infringing the intellectual property rights of others. we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by competitors and intellectual property rights granted to competitors. failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, energy costs, pension and healthcare costs and foreign exchange and interest rates. therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. in addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results. we face risks that are inherent in global manufacturing that could negatively impact our business results. we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, to achieve our cost targets. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, it may be impracticable to have a sufficient alternative source, particularly when the input materials are in limited supply. in addition, our strategy for global growth includes increased presence in emerging markets. some emerging markets have greater political volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. any significant disruption of manufacturing, such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. 16 the procter &amp; gamble company we face risks associated with having significant international operations. we are a global company, with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue is outside the u.s. our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, such as the foreign corrupt practices act; compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws; changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; changes in exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas; discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales outside the united states. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization or pricing controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, argentina, china, india and egypt. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. we hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the united states are translated into u.s. dollars. our operations outside of the u.s. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. we face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets. our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which continue to be volatile. our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. if the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to: a slow-down in the general economy; supplier, vendor or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets; and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets. any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. we could also be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments. for example, we could be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states. consequently, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographies, as well as any political or economic disruption. these risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing costs, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. in addition, many of our brands have worldwide recognition. this recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years. the quality and safety of our products is critical to our business. our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, these issues could negatively impact sentiments toward the company or our products, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit the procter &amp; gamble company 17 products. in addition, given the association of our individual products with the company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the company as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results. our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. we recently experienced a ceo transition, as well as other senior leadership changes, and we continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes, which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of particularly key employees, is critical to our business success. further, ongoing business and organizational changes are likely to result in more reliance on third parties for various services and that reliance may increase reputational, operational and compliance risks, including the risk of corruption. we are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense. finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, 2) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands, or 3) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with each joint venture. our business is subject to changes in legislation, regulation and enforcement, and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the united states and abroad. changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. as a u.s. based multinational company we are subject to tax regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the united states is not taxed in the united states, provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. if these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. in addition, our ability to manage regulatory, environmental, tax and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal matters, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. there are increasing calls in the united states from members of leadership in both major u.s. political parties for comprehensive tax reform which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to u.s. domiciled corporations, such as p&amp;g. it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flows, but such changes could significantly impact our financial results. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which consist of mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, high-frequency stores, distributors and e-commerce retailers. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. consolidation among our retail customers could also create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complexity across broader geographic boundaries for both us 18 the procter &amp; gamble company and our key retailers. this would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures, local law and regulation changes or financial distress. a failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. if the it systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. the procter &amp; gamble company 45risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the the procter &amp; gamble company 13 time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. a change in consumer demand for our products and/or lack of market growth could have a significant impact on our business. we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by focusing on the most profitable businesses, biggest innovations and most important emerging markets. we also expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. if demand for our products and/or market growth rates, in either developed or developing markets, falls substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our volume, and consequently our results, could be negatively impacted. this could occur due to, among other things, unforeseen negative economic or political events, unexpected changes in consumer trends and habits or negative consumer responses to pricing actions. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. this includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products in both developed and developing markets. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer and consumer preferences, as well as market dynamics. failure to effectively compete in these new channels could negatively impact results. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and our ability to successfully respond to competitive innovation . achieving our business results depends, in part, on the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products and improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of others. we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by competitors and intellectual property rights granted to competitors. failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our results. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, energy costs, pension and healthcare costs and foreign exchange and interest rates. therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. in addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. failure to deliver these savings could adversely impact our results. we face risks that are inherent in global manufacturing that could negatively impact our business results. we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, to achieve our cost targets. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, it may be impracticable to have a sufficient alternative source, particularly when the input materials are in limited supply. in addition, our strategy for global growth includes increased presence in emerging markets. some emerging markets have greater political volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. any significant disruption of manufacturing, such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business. 14 the procter &amp; gamble company we rely on third parties in many aspect our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties for certain functions, such as our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners or external business partners. while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and/or operational risk. we face risks associated with having significant international operations. we are a global company, with manufacturing operations in more than 40 countries and a significant portion of our revenue outside the u.s. our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to: compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, such as the foreign corrupt practices act; compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws; changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; changes in exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas; discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales outside the u.s. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization or pricing controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, argentina, china, india and egypt. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. we hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the u.s. are translated into u.s. dollars. our operations outside of the u.s. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. we face risks related to changes in the global and political economic environment, including the global capital and credit markets. our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which continue to be volatile. our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. if the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to: a slow-down in the general economy; supplier, vendor or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets; and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets. any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. we could also be negatively impacted by political issues or crises in individual countries or regions, including sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments. for example, we could be adversely impacted by instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the u.s. consequently, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographies, as well as any political or economic disruption. these risks could negatively impact our overall liquidity and financing costs, as well as our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, and/or create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. in addition, many of our brands have worldwide recognition. this recognition is the result of the large investments we have made in our products over many years. the quality and safety of our products is critical to our business. our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. if we are unable to effectively the procter &amp; gamble company 15 manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted; our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands and the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. negative or inaccurate postings or comments about the company could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands. in addition, given the association of our individual products with the company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the company as a whole, thereby potentially hurting results. our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. we continue to execute a number of significant business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes, which may include many staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of particularly key employees, is critical to our business success. we are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense. our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities could impact our business results. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, 2) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with divested brands, or 3) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. our business is subject to changes in legislation, regulation and enforcement, and our ability to manage and resolve pending legal matters in the u.s. and abroad. changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and increased enforcement actions and penalties may alter the environment in which we do business. the increasingly complex and rapidly changing legal and regulatory environment creates additional challenges for our ethics and compliance programs. our ability to continue to meet these challenges could have an impact on our legal, reputational and business risk. as a u.s.-based multinational company, we are subject to tax regulations in the u.s. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the u.s. is not taxed in the u.s., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. if these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. for example, there are increasing calls in the u.s. from members of leadership in both major u.s. political parties for comprehensive tax reform which may significantly change the income tax rules that are applicable to u.s. domiciled corporations, such as p&amp;g. it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential legislation would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flows, but such changes could significantly impact our financial results. our ability to manage regulatory, environmental, tax (including, but not limited to, any audits or other investigations) and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability may materially impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal matters, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which consist of mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this includes 16 the procter &amp; gamble company our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. consolidation among our retail customers could also create significant cost and margin pressure and lead to more complexity across broader geographic boundaries for both us and our key retailers. this would be particularly challenging if major customers are addressing local trade pressures, local law and regulation changes or financial distress. a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. the company has made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, employee training and security policies for the company and its third-party providers. however, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. if the it systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. the costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 44 the procter &amp; gamble companyrisk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with the md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. the procter &amp; gamble company 14 our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. we are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. we hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and our operations outside the u.s. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies, such as the recent volatility in the russian ruble, may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in u.s. dollars) in those markets, or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in different countries could adversely affect our results. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. we also have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls, including argentina, china, egypt, greece, india, nigeria, ukraine and venezuela. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business outside the u.s., such as the current year impact of deconsolidating our venezuelan subsidiaries as discussed in this form 10-k. additionally, our business, operations or employees may be affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets, which could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations. uncertain global economic conditions, including disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating, may adversely impact demand for our products, cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship or reduce our access to credit, all of which could adversely impact our business. our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of our previously-announced supply chain simplifications and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. in addition, our financial projections include cost savings described in our announced productivity plan. failure to manage these fluctuations and deliver the planned cost savings could adversely impact our financial results. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid 15 the procter &amp; gamble company infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. this includes, among other things, increasing competition from mid- and lower-tier value products, including private-label products, in both developed and developing markets. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics. failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in new sales channels could negatively impact our results. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. continued consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. many of our brands have worldwide recognition, and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners or external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transmitting, transferring and storing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; the procter &amp; gamble company 16 providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the company is continually increasing its sensitivity and attention to these threats. we continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills, employee training and security policies for the company and its third-party providers. however, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. our it systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' databases or systems. if the it systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. the costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. we must successfully manage compliance with legislation, regulation and enforcement, as well as pending legal matters in the u.s. and abroad. our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, privacy, environmental, employment, anti-bribery or anti-corruption (such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act) or other matters. rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, including changes in accounting standards, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for our compliance and ethics programs and may alter the environment in which we do business. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. because the u.s. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and u.s. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the u.s. is not taxed in the u.s., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. if those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the u.s., additional residual u.s. taxation will likely occur, due to the u.s.'s worldwide tax system and higher u.s. corporate tax rate. the u.s. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the u.s. international tax rules. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving , such as the base erosion and profit shifting project ( beps") currently being undertaken by the g8, g20, and organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"). as these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. if we are unable to successfully execute our portfolio optimization strategy, as well as successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities, it could adversely impact our business. in august 2014, the company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands, resulting in a portfolio of about 65 brands. the company has announced a series of transactions that will substantially complete this plan. it will take time to execute this plan, and our ability to successfully do so could impact our results. in addition, as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands. our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. 17 the procter &amp; gamble company our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change. our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement, including those described in our announced productivity plan and our portfolio-optimization strategy. if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. we expect these types of changes, which will include staffing adjustments as well as employee departures, to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully executing these changes, including effective management transitions at leadership levels of the company and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. we are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense. it also includes continued development and execution of robust leadership succession plans, including successful execution of our recently announced ceo transition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. the procter &amp; gamble company 42risk factors 2 risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with the md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. the procter &amp; gamble company 3 our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. we are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. we hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and our operations outside the u.s. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies, such as the recent volatility in the russian ruble, may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in u.s. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in different countries could adversely affect our results. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. we also have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls, including argentina, egypt, nigeria and ukraine. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business outside the u.s. additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of our previously-announced supply chain simplifications and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we must also be able to successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. failure to continually innovate, improve and 4 the procter &amp; gamble company respond to competitive moves could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. in addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online. failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce, could negatively impact our results. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. continued consolidation among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of our products or experience a significant business disruption. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. many of our brands have worldwide recognition, and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. our company also devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners or external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. an information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing, and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, regulatory, and other stakeholder information and personal data; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; the procter &amp; gamble company 5 collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the availability and integrity of our critical business operations. as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the company is continually increasing its sensitivity and attention to these threats. we continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills, employee training and security policies for the company and its third-party providers. however, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. our it databases and systems and our third party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyber-attacks. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third party providers will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' databases or systems. if the it systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not

business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. the united kingdom's departure from the european union could adversely impact our business and financial results. on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted for the united kingdom to exit the european union ( brexit ), the announcement of which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets. it is expected that the british government will commence negotiations to determine the terms of brexit. given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect the company are unclear. brexit could, among other things, disrupt trade and the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty. these and other potential implications of brexit could adversely affect the company's business and financial results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and

to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third party relationships and the agreements under which our third party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. an information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information technology (it) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data; summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; the procter &amp; gamble company 5 collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our it systems, networks and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. we continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including monitoring of networks and systems, increasing information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the company and its third-party providers. however, because the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or mitigating harms after such an attack. our it databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyber-attacks. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' databases or systems. if the it systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of key operations or disclosure of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security incidents, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. for example, the united kingdom's decision to leave the european union has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the u.k.'s future legal and economic framework and how the u.k. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services and people. in addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services and people between countries and other matters. the potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations and market contraction, could adversely affect the company's business and financial results. we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the u.s. and abroad. our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, privacy, environmental, employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the company, including our compliance and ethics programs, and may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. because the u.s. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and u.s. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the u.s. is not taxed in the u.s., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. if those same foreign earnings are instead repatriated to the u.s., additional residual u.s. taxation will likely occur, due to the u.s.'s worldwide tax system and higher u.s. corporate tax rate. the u.s. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the corporate tax rate and the u.s. international tax rules. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements ( beps") recommended by the g8, g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"). as these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be 6 the procter &amp; gamble company cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. while we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands. our financial results could also be impacted in the event of acquisitions or joint venture activities if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. additionally, successfully executing management transitions at leadership levels of the company and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. we are generally a build-from-within company and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. the procter &amp; gamble company 33risk factors 2 risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with the md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. the procter &amp; gamble company 3 our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. we are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. we hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and our operations outside the u.s. generate a significant portion of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in u.s. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including potential changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as nigeria, algeria and egypt. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. in addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we 4 the procter &amp; gamble company must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. in addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online and growth in hard discounter channels. failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. an information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. as part of the company's regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology ( it/ot ) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. as part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the company's plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the audit the procter &amp; gamble company 5 committee and the board of directors. despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this it/ot risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. we rely extensively on it/ot systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it/ot systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ); summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. we assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the company and its third-party providers. however, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. our it/ot databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' it/ot databases or systems. periodically, we also need to upgrade our it/ot systems or adopt new technologies. if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. further, if the it/ot systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. for example, the united kingdom's decision to leave the european union has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the u.k.'s future legal and economic framework and how the u.k. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. in addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. the potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the company's business and financial results. we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the u.s. and abroad. our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including 6 the procter &amp; gamble company those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. rapidly changing laws, regulations and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the company, including our compliance and ethics programs, and may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. for example, on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the u.s. tax act ). the changes included in the u.s. tax act are broad and complex. the final transition impacts of the u.s. tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the u.s. tax act, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise because of the u.s. tax act or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements ( beps") recommended by the g8, g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"). as these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. while we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures such as the termination of the pgt healthcare partnership between the company and teva pharmaceutical industries. our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the planned acquisition of merck kgaa's consumer health business, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 34 the procter &amp; gamble companyrisk factors 2 risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, quarterly and annual reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with the md&amp;a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. we are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. we hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and our operations outside the u.s. generate more than fifty percent of our net revenue. fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in u.s. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as nigeria, algeria, egypt and turkey. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. in addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. the procter &amp; gamble company 3 disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. in addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories, and growth in hard discounter channels. failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results could also be negatively impacted if 4 the procter &amp; gamble company one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer. our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. an information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. as part of the company's regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology ( it/ot ) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. as part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the company's plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the audit committee and the board of directors. despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this it/ot risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. we rely extensively on it/ot systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it/ot systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ); summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. as cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. we assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the company and its third-party providers. however, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. our it/ot databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. such attacks may originate from the procter &amp; gamble company 5 outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. in addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. to date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' it/ot databases or systems. periodically, we also need to upgrade our it/ot systems or adopt new technologies. if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. further, if the it/ot systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. for example, the united kingdom's pending withdrawal from the european union ("brexit") has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the u.k.'s future legal and economic framework and how the u.k. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. in addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. the potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the company's business and financial results. we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the u.s. and abroad. our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or disposability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our financial results. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. for example, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the u.s. tax act ). the changes included in the u.s. tax act are broad and complex. the ongoing impacts of the u.s. tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the company has used to calculate the impacts. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting ( beps") project is a new project undertaken by the 129 member countries of the expanded oecd inclusive framework focused on "addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy." the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. as this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. while we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 6 the procter &amp; gamble company beauty brands transaction with coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. our financial results could also be impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the integration of merck kgaa's consumer health business acquired in fiscal 2019, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including the move to a new organizational structure in fiscal 2020, management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 30 the procter &amp; gamble companyrisk factors 2 risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on form 8-k, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required by law. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially. our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. we are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. we hold assets, incur liabilities, generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and our operations outside the u.s. generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales. fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the u.s. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in u.s. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as nigeria, algeria, argentina, egypt and turkey. our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. additionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. uncertain economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions. these disruptions have included and may in the future include: a slow-down or recession in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the the procter &amp; gamble company 3 materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. in addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and cash flow, it could affect the company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain. our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have interrupted product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. in addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories, and growth in hard discounter channels. failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. 4 the procter &amp; gamble company if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. a significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information and operational technology ("it/ot") systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it/ot systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) or residents of california covered by the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"); summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. in addition, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. the procter &amp; gamble company 5 our it/ot databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. in addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' it/ot databases or systems. if the it/ot systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. periodically, we also upgrade our it/ot systems or adopt new technologies. if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. for example, the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union ("brexit") has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the u.k.'s future legal and economic framework and how the u.k. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. in addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and export controls and the general movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. the potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the company's results of operations and cash flows. we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the u.s. and abroad. our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or end-of-life responsibility, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including increasing focus on the climate, water, and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies' operations and products), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. for example, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the u.s. tax act ). the changes included in the u.s. tax act are broad and complex. the ongoing impacts of the u.s. tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the company has used to calculate the impacts. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit shifting ( beps") project is a project undertaken by the more than 130 member countries of the expanded oecd inclusive framework focused on "addressing the challenges of the digitalization of the economy." the breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to 6 the procter &amp; gamble company impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. as this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. while we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 beauty brands transaction with coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. we must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. specifically, our financial results have been, and in the future could be, adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. our results of operations and cash flows have been and, in the future could also be, impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change, including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning. our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. additionally, successfully executing organizational change, management transitions at leadership levels of the company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals. our success depends on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. we must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns. our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. these impacts include, but are not limited to: significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity. if prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows; inability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, or other manufacturing and distribution capability; failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which the procter &amp; gamble company 7 could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. quantitative and qualitative disclosures a bout market risk 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled other information under management's disclosure and analysis, and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. the procter &amp; gamble company 33risk factors 2 risk factors. we discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on form 8-k, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required by law. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially. our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. we are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. we hold assets, incur liabilities, generate sales and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and our operations outside the u.s. generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales. fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the u.s. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-u.s. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in u.s. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. see also the results of operations and cash flow, financial condition and liquidity sections of the md&amp;a, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. we also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as nigeria, algeria, argentina, egypt and turkey. our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. additionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. uncertain economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions. these disruptions have included and may in the future include: a slow-down or recession in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the the procter &amp; gamble company 3 materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. in addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and cash flow, it could affect the company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. a disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain. our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have interrupted product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows. our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . we are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. the success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. we must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. the ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. the consumer products industry is highly competitive. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. in addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories, and growth in hard discounter channels. failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows. a significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. our success depends on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. 4 the procter &amp; gamble company if the reputation of the company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. the quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. the success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the company. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. our company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. if these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the company's reputation and results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted. we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results. additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. a significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. we rely extensively on information and operational technology ("it/ot") systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. the various uses of these it/ot systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the european union who are covered by the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) or residents of california covered by the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"); summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. in addition, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. the procter &amp; gamble company 5 our it/ot databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. in addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' it/ot databases or systems. if the it/ot systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. periodically, we also upgrade our it/ot systems or adopt new technologies. if such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. the costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. for example, the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union ("brexit") has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the u.k.'s future legal and economic framework and how the u.k. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. in addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and export controls and the general movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. the potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the company's results of operations and cash flows. we must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the u.s. and abroad. our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or end-of-life responsibility, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including increasing focus on the climate, water, and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies' operations and products), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. for example, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the u.s. tax act ). the changes included in the u.s. tax act are broad and complex. the ongoing impacts of the u.s. tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the company has used to calculate the impacts. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. an outgrowth of the original base erosion and profit

necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which the procter &amp; gamble company 7 could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. despite our

business outlook and objectives in this form 10-k, the annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. all statements, except for historical and present factual information, are forward-looking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out of date or incomplete. we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management discussion and analysis (md a) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight 6 table of contents what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. a material change in the demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. in addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, primarily gillette, could impact our business results. since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the gillette company. specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. in addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to

particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. our costs in 2006 were impacted by higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2007. therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. in the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. we face risks associated with significant international operations. we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the

future financial performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management discussion and analysis (md a) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. we are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and products. to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher margin businesses. if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits. in addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations. this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world. the ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local and global competitors. across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. as a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. to address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents granted to competition. our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, primarily gillette, could impact our business results. since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of the gillette company. specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. in addition, our

to real or perceived quality issues. a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade

states. as a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. that can increase our exposure. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, china and india. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks. further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in

desired impact on a brand image or its ability to attract consumers. further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. in addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. further, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted if: 1) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions, 2) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value or 3) we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue streams associated with divested brands. our business is subject to regulation in the u.s. and abroad. changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. this includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k, which could require us to take significant reserves or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. in addition, as a u.s. based multinational company we are also subject to tax regulations in the u.s. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. for example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the u.s. is not taxed in the u.s., provided those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. if these or other tax regulations should change, our financial results could be impacted. 6 a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers. this includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation, which can create significant cost and margin pressure and could lead to more complex work across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. this can be particularly difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation changes. in addition, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products. we face risks related to the current credit crisis. we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. however, current uncertainty in global economic conditions, resulting from disruptions in credit markets, poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. if the current situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. if the current credit crisis were to continue to worsen such that we were unable to access the credit market, it could impair our ability to fund discretionary spending. a failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to interact with internal and external stakeholders. these interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about

continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions. in the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements. 5 we face risks associated with significant international operations. we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the united states. as a result, we are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues and earnings received and/or balances held by or invested in our foreign subsidiaries, as well as exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. that can increase our exposure. we have sizable businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of foreign countries with exchange controls, including, but not limited to, venezuela, china and india. our results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. further, we expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. in addition, economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other hostile activities. if the reputation of the company or one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. the company reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies. if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the company, our ability to operate freely could be impaired and our financial results could suffer. our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands, particularly our billion-dollar brands. the success of these brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand image or its ability to attract consumers. further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational change could impact our business results. we have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes including acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects to support our growth strategies. we expect these types of changes to continue for the foreseeable future. successfully managing these changes, including retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. in addition, we are generally a build-from-within company, and our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. this includes developing organization capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled employees is limited and competition for these resources is intense. further, business and organizational changes may result in more reliance on third parties for various services, and that reliance may increase compliance risks, including anti-corruption. finally, our financial targets assume a consistent level of productivity improvement. if we are unable to deliver expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities could impact our business results. as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of acquisition and divestiture

legislation, regulation and enforcement in the u.s. and abroad. changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations and increased enforcement actions may alter the environment in which we do business. this includes changes in competition, product-related, privacy and environmental laws, including actions in response to global climate change concerns, increased enforcement as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and enforcement penalties. accordingly, our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and other intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k, which could require us to take significant reserves in excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period, may materially impact our results. in addition, as a

reduce the range or inventory level of our products. we face risks related to changes in the global economic environment. our business is impacted by global economic conditions, which are increasingly volatile. if the global economy experiences significant disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries

basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. in addition, we are transitioning our ordering,
