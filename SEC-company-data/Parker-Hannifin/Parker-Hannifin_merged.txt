risk factors . the following risk factors identify what the company believes to be all of the risks that could materially adversely affect the company's financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. uncertainty regarding global economic conditions and the rate of economic recovery may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins and order rates. the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company cannot predict changes in worldwide economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the company's control. if these conditions deteriorate, however, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems. the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business. if these systems - 8 - are damaged or cease to function properly and the company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business, the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to product liability risks. the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from legal and regulatory proceedings. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. the company also commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products. demand for and supply of the company's products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control. such factors include: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs; changes in product mix; changes in the market acceptance of the company's products; increased competition in the markets the company serves; declines in the general level of industrial production; and declines in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials. if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company's products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the company's production processes and by its suppliers of component parts. the company's supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company's ability to increase the price of its products, or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors. the company's suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. - 9 - the company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company's ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates. the company's operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company's margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company's industrial segment and climate &amp; industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability, quality, delivery and service, and price competitiveness. the company may be subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations. the company's net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 45% in fiscal 2012, 46% in fiscal 2011 and 45% in fiscal 2010. in addition, many of the company's manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company's non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on the company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; potentially adverse tax consequences; and difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits - 10 - by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologies. the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company's ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company's competitive position. the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business could present increased risks that the company's intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the united states. in such cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from the impact of environmental regulations. the company's operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various united states federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, the company is subject to the united states federal superfund law, under which it has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency's superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a cap-and-trade system globally. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company's business, operations or financial results. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits. the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and the company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government. - 11 - in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.risk factors . the following risk factors identify what the company believes to be all of the risks that could materially adversely affect the company's financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions. uncertainty regarding economic conditions and the rate of economic recovery globally and in economic regions in which the company conducts substantial operations, including western europe, which is experiencing long-term economic downturn and uncertainty, may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins and order rates. the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the company's control. if these conditions deteriorate, however, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems. the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business. if these systems are damaged, intruded upon, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, other cyber-security incidents or otherwise) and the company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business, the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to product liability risks. the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal - 9 - judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. the company also commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and

changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs; changes in product mix; changes in the market acceptance of the company's products; increased competition in the markets the company serves; declines in the general level of industrial production; and declines in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials. if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company's products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the company's production processes and by its suppliers of component parts. the company's supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the

parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures depends on the company's ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. - 10 - the company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates. the company's operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company's margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer service. the company may be subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations. the company's net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 44% in fiscal 2013, 45% in fiscal 2012, and 46% in fiscal 2011. in addition, many of the company's manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company's non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on the company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; potentially adverse tax consequences; and difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologies. the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company's ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company's competitive position. - 11 - the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or the company's inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from the impact of environmental regulations. the company's operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various united states federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the

addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a cap-and-trade system globally. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company's business, operations or financial results. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits. the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and the company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government. in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. currently, the u.s. government is under mandated sequestration, which has resulted in a reduction of funds available to support u.s. governmental operations, including the acquisition of products and services from contractors. the full impact of the sequestration is not fully known, but a material change in the u.s. government's spending could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. - 12 -risk factors . the following "risk factors" identify what the company believes to be the risks that could materially adversely affect the company's financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions. global macro-economic conditions and the rate of economic recovery have stabilized to an extent; however, declining or relatively flat growth persists in the economic regions in which the company conducts substantial operations, including western europe. the continued effects of the global economic downturn and the rate of recovery may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins and order rates. the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the company's control. if these conditions deteriorate or do not return to previous levels, however, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems. the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business. if these systems are damaged, intruded upon, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, other cyber-security incidents or otherwise) and the - 8 - company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business or if its products are effected, the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to product liability risks. the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. the company also engages in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. the company further commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company also cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products. demand for and supply of the company's products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control. such factors include: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs; changes in product mix; changes in the market acceptance of the company's products; increased competition in the markets the company serves; declines in the general level of industrial production; and declines in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials. - 9 - if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company's products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the company's production processes and by its suppliers of component parts. the company's supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company's ability to increase the price of its products, or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors. the company's suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures depend on the company's ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates. the company's operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company's margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer service. the company may be subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations. the company's net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 44% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013, and 45% in fiscal 2012. in addition, many of the company's manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company's non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; - 10 - difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on the company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; potentially adverse tax consequences; and difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologies. the markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company's ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce revenues and materially adversely affect the company's competitive position. the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or the company's inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. - 11 - the company may be subject to risks arising from the impact of environmental regulations. the company's operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various united states federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, the company is subject to the united states federal "superfund" law, under which it has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency's superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a "cap-and-trade" system globally. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company's business, operations or financial results. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits. the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the company's results of operations. the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and the company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government. in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations.risk factors . the following "risk factors" identify what the company believes to be the risks that could materially adversely affect the company's financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions. the company's business is sensitive to global macro-economic conditions. slow economic growth persists in the economic regions in which the company conducts substantial operations, including western europe and brazil. the continued effects of the global economic downturn and the rate of recovery may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other end-market activity, currency exchange rates, air travel trends, difficulties entering new markets, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins, and order rates. the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, engaging in various business realignment initiatives, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and managing its cash. the company cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the company's control. if these conditions deteriorate or do not return to previous levels, however, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations. the company's net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 42% in fiscal 2015 and approximately 44% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013. in addition, many of the company's manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company's non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including: - 8 - fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on the company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; potentially adverse tax consequences; and difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. the company also engages in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. the company further commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company also cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. the company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures depend on the company's ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems. the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business, some of which are managed by third parties. the security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. if these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, or other cyber-security incidents) and the company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business or if its products are effected, the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. - 9 - the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products. demand for and supply of the company's products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control. such factors include: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs; changes in product mix; changes in the market acceptance of the company's products; increased competition in the markets the company serves; declines in the general level of industrial production; weakness in the end-markets the company serves; fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials; and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company's products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologies. the markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company's ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. if the company does not develop, or has difficulties or delays in the development of, innovative new and enhanced products and services, or fails to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies, the company's revenues may be materially reduced and the company's competitive position could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the company may invest in research and development of products and services, or in acquisitions or other investments, that do not lead to significant revenue, which could adversely affect our profitability. the company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the company's production processes and by its suppliers of component parts. the company's supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company's ability to increase the price of its products, or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows. the company's suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates. the company's operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company's margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer service. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. - 10 - the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. the company's future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to product liability risks. the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon

nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use of

that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property 11 table of contents rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or the company's inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from the impact of environmental regulations. the company's operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various united states federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, the company is subject to the united states federal "superfund" law, under which it has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency's superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a "cap-and-trade" system globally. increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company's business, operations or financial results. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits. the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the company's results of operations. the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and the company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government. in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27risk factors 8 risk factors . the following "risk factors" identify what the company believes to be the risks that could materially adversely affect the company's financial and/or operational performance. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8 table of contents the company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions. the company's business is sensitive to global macro-economic conditions. moderate economic growth persists in the economic regions in which the company conducts substantial operations. future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other end-market activity, currency exchange rates, air travel trends, difficulties entering new markets, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these factors may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company's revenues, operating profits, margins, and order rates. the company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond the company's control. if these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods, however, the company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations. the company's net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 40% in 2017 , 41% in 2016 and 42% in 2015 . in addition, many of the company's manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company's non-u.s. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on the company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; potentially adverse tax consequences; and difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures, and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies, including risks related to the integration of clarcor inc. ("clarcor") . the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. furthermore, there are no 9 table of contents assurances that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the company may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable. specifically, the company is devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of clarcor with the businesses of the company. the company may encounter the following difficulties during the integration process of clarcor: the consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the cost of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the clarcor acquisition may not be realized; delays in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products, and services; differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies that may delay successful integration; the ability to retain key employees; the ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems; challenges of integrating complex systems, technologies, networks, and other assets of clarcor, into the company's, in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact or disruptions to customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies; and unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration beyond current estimates. the successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on the company's ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company's results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of clarcor are not effectively managed. the company's acquisition of clarcor greatly expanded the size and complexity of its business. the company's future success depends, in part, on the ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products, and the associated costs and complexity. there can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that the company will realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of clarcor. the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. the company also engages in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. the company further commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company also cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. the company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems. the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business, some of which are managed by third parties. the security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. if these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and the company suffers any resulting interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business or if its products are effected, the company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products. demand for and supply of the company's products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control. such factors include: 10 table of contents changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs; changes in product mix; changes in the market acceptance of the company's products; increased competition in the markets the company serves; declines in the general level of industrial production; weakness in the end-markets the company serves; fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials; and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company's products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologies. the markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company's ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. if the company does not develop, or has difficulties or delays in the development of, innovative new and enhanced products and services, or fails to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies, the company's revenues may be materially reduced and the company's competitive position could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the company may invest in research and development of products and services, or in acquisitions or other investments, that do not lead to significant revenue, which could adversely affect our profitability. the company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the company's production processes and by its suppliers of component parts. the company's supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company's ability to increase the price of its products, or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows. the company's suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. the company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operates. the company's operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company's margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer service. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. the company's future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations. 11 table of contents in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to product liability risks. the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, and legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world and in the operation of its business. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use or

the company must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer experience. the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act, or the tcj act, was enacted into law. the tcj act significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, by, among other things, establishing a flat corporate u.s. income tax rate of 21 percent and creating a territorial tax system (with a one-time transition tax imposed on previously unremitted foreign earnings and profits). the company's future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof (including regulations under and interpretations of the tcj act), the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or regulations. for example, the company's estimate of the net one-time charge incurred related to the tcj act could differ materially from the company's actual liability, due to, among other things, further refinement of the calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made, additional guidance that may be issued by the u.s. treasury department and internal revenue service, and any other actions the company may make as a result of the tcj act. in addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company's tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company may be subject to product liability risks. the company's businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from litigation, and legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations. from time to time, the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. an unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the company's assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations. the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, relating to its business and its employees. despite the company's policies, procedures and compliance programs, its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. any such improper acts could damage the company's reputation, subject it to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact the company's business, financial condition or results of operations. 12 table of contents the company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property in its products and services throughout the world and in the operation of its business. the company also has exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company's business increases the risk that the company's intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others. in some cases, the company's ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. unauthorized use or disclosure of the company's intellectual property rights or the company's inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from the impact of environmental regulations. the company's operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various u.s. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-u.s. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, the company is subject to the u.s. federal "superfund" law, under which it has been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency's superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a "cap-and-trade" system globally. increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company's business, operations or financial results. the company may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. the company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits. the funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the company's results of operations. the company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. if healthcare costs rise significantly and the company continues to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact the company's future results of operations. the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government. in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company's failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, and the company could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract non-compliance or resulting from such investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28risk factors 8 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28risk factors 8 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the company enters into forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts and cross-currency swap agreements to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in related foreign currencies. the total value of open contracts and any risk to the company as a result of these arrangements is not material to the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. the company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the company to interest rate risk. the company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near term interest rates. the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a $200 million notional principal amount. the swap agreement converts a portion of its variable rate debt to a fixed rate through 2004. the agreement is with a major financial institution and the risk of loss is considered remote. the carrying and fair value of this agreement is not material to the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. a one hundred basis point increase in near term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt by approximately $6.0 million. for further discussion see the significant accounting policies footnote on pages 13-15 to 13-17 of exhibit 13 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.risk factors . the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the risk factors described below are those that the company believes are currently the most significant. additional risk factors not currently known to the company or that the company believes are immaterial also may impair the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations. in fiscal year 2006, approximately 37% of the company net sales were derived from customers outside the united states. in addition, many of the company manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; -7- labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and potentially adverse tax consequences. if the company is unable to manage successfully the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. demand for and supply of the company products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control, which could adversely affect its results of operations. numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the company products, including: changes in the market acceptance of its products; increased competition in the markets it serves; changes in economic conditions in individual markets; declines in the general level of industrial production; or declines in the availability or increases in the prices of raw materials. if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company products could suffer, which would adversely affect its results of operations. the company operates in a highly competitive environment. the company domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. to compete successfully, the company industrial segment and climate and industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability, quality, delivery and service, and price competitiveness. the financial resources and performance of certain of the company competitors may put the company at a competitive disadvantage, which would adversely affect its results of operations. the company future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies and preservation of its intellectual property. the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially adversely affect the company competitive position. -8- protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact the company competitive position and results of operations. the raw materials used in the company production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase the company costs of products and adversely affect the company results of operations. the company supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company results of operations and profit margins. while the company generally attempts to pass along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company ability to increase the price of its products, or it may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors. the company suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture their component parts. in those circumstances, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. the company may face limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. in addition, no guarantee can be given that the company will be able to integrate successfully any business that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. potential product liability risks exist from the products that the company sells. -9- the company businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance. there can be no assurance, however, that the company will be able to maintain its product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its product liability insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. in the event of a claim against it, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. moreover, even if it maintains adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance. the company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject. the company operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other environmental laws, the

costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. the company does business with the u.s government and as such is subject to increased government regulations. in addition to normal business risks, doing business with the u.s. government subjects the company to increased risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations. changes in the company tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability. -10- the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company tax liabilities. increasing costs of

also may impair the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company is subject to adverse changes in worldwide economic conditions and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets. the extended deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and the resulting volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. these effects have, among other things, negatively impacted the level of capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company revenues, operating profits and margins and order rates. the company remains focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash through various initiatives, including workforce reductions, salary freezes and short work weeks. there can be no assurance, however, that that these or any other initiatives or contingency plans implemented by the company to further control costs will be successful. the company cannot predict the duration or severity of the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and the resulting volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets or if or when conditions will improve. these conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the company control. if these conditions continue for a significant period of

product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. in the event of a claim against it, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. moreover, even if the company maintains adequate insurance, a successful claim could still have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. the company future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies. the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company competitive position. - 12 - the company future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company business could present increased risks that the company intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the united states. in such case, the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states. unauthorized use of the company intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company competitive position and results of operations. the company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject. the company operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various united states federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. these laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. among other laws, the company is subject to the united states federal superfund law, under which it has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. the company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings. the company is a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. an unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the company business, financial condition or results of operations. - 13 - the company does business with the united states government and as such is subject to government regulations. in addition to normal business risks, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the company failure to perform under the applicable contract. the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations. changes in the company tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-united states authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations. increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company results of operations. the amount of expenses recorded for the company defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact the company future results of operations.risk factors . the following risk factors identify what the company believes to be all of the risks that could materially and adversely affect the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. these risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company is subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. current uncertainty regarding global economic conditions and the existence and rate of any economic recovery may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. these effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the company revenues, operating profits and margins and order rates. during the second half of fiscal 2010, the company began to see signs of an economic recovery. throughout the worldwide economic downturn, the company focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. the company win strategy initiatives relating to growth and margin improvement as well as the implementation of a number of business realignment initiatives, including plant closures and general workforce reductions, continue to help meet this objective. there can be no assurance, however, that these or any other initiatives or contingency plans implemented by the company will be successful or that the company will have sufficient resources to manage the recovery if the economy rebounds more quickly than anticipated. the company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will improve. these conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the company control. if these conditions deteriorate, however, the company business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. - 11 - the company is subject to risks relating to its information technology systems. the company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business. if these systems are damaged or cease to function properly and the company suffers any interruption in its ability to manage and operate its business, the company results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. potential product liability risks exist from the products that the company sells. the company businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. in the event of a claim against it, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. moreover, even if the company maintains adequate insurance, a successful claim could still have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. the company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings. the company is a defendant from time to time in litigation and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. an unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the company business, financial condition or results of operations. the company is subject to risks relating to organizational changes. the company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. in addition, the company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. demand for and supply of the company products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the company cannot predict or control, which would adversely affect its results of operations. numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the company products, including: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs; changes in the market acceptance of its products; increased competition in the markets it serves; - 12 - declines in the general level of industrial production; or declines in the availability, or increases in the prices, of raw materials. if any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the company products could suffer, which would adversely affect its results of operations. the raw materials used in the company production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase the costs of products and adversely affect our results of operations. the company supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company results of operations and profit margins. although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the company ability to increase the price of its products, or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure, sales contracts or other factors. the company suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. as a result, the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. consequently, the company results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. the company may face various risks relating to acquisitions, including limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. the company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. however, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms. in addition, there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities, that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable. the successful integration of new businesses depends on the company ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. if the company is unable to avoid these risks, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. the company operates in a highly competitive environment. the company domestic and foreign operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global and local competitors, which could adversely affect the company results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in the company margins or market shares. to compete successfully, the company industrial segment and climate &amp; industrial controls segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its aerospace segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability, quality, delivery and service, and price competitiveness. - 13 - the company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations. the company net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 45% in fiscal 2010, 44% in fiscal 2009 and 47% in fiscal 2008. in addition, many of the company manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. the company foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations, including: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; transportation delays and interruptions; political, social and economic instability and disruptions; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export controls; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; potentially adverse tax consequences; and difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. changes in the company tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability. the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. the company effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-united states authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations. - 14 - the obama administration has proposed legislation that would change how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on their foreign income. if such legislation is enacted, the company effective tax rate and, in turn, the company profitability, could be materially impacted. the company future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies. the markets the company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. the company ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company competitive position. the company future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property. protecting the company intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. the company intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. in addition, the global nature of the company business could present increased risks that the company intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the united states. in such case, the company ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or

the company is subject to the united states federal superfund law, under which it has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the united states environmental protection agency superfund priority list. the company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the superfund law. - 15 - in addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including regulation of such emissions through a cap-and-trade system in the united states. changes in or to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. while such regulation appears likely in the united states, until definitive regulations are adopted, the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the company business, operations or financial results. the company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations and financial condition. increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the company results of operations. the amount of expenses recorded for the company defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase expenses and may adversely impact the company future results of operations. the company does business with the united states government and as such is subject to government regulations. in addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the united states government subjects the company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. agreements relating to the sale

company businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that the company uses or resells. significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. the company may be subject to risks arising from legal and regulatory proceedings. from time to time, the company is subject to

subject to risks relating to its non-u.s. operations. the company net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 46% in fiscal 2011, 45% in fiscal 2010 and 44% in fiscal 2009. in addition, many of the company manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states. the company expects net sales from non-u.s. markets to continue to represent a
